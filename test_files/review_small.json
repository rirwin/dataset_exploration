The experience has been entirely positive and I would recommend that anyone who is interested in health, fitness, or martial arts to give the class a try.  Here's some general information about the classes and the type of training offered at this school.  I hope you find it helpful.\n \nThe Programs\nThe programs are split up into individual segments so that you can choose only those that you are interested in.  The segments are split between Chi Kung, Kung Fu Fitness, and Kung Fu Practical.  There's also a free or optional donation meditation class on Saturdays which include an open discussion on spirituality, with a focus on Chan Buddhism (Note: don't let this optional section scare you off, this school does not preach religion or require you to believe in any particular faith).  It's up to the individual to choose which segments they are interested in signing up for.  Each segment runs between 45min to an hr long and are open to individuals of all fitness levels.  The degree of difficulty will ultimately depend on how hard you push yourself.  Instructor Dao recommends taking Kung Fu Fitness on its own first before taking the combination Kung Fu Fit/Practical classes which takes close to 2 hours.  I've personally found that individual with some fitness background can generally start with both classes while those with little experience will want to start with Kung Fu Fit first.  Chi Kung classes are typically scheduled right before Kung Fu classes, so if you decide to sign up for all three, be prepared for a 3 hour session.  \n\nThe Training\nThe style of training is rooted in developing foundational skills through repetition.  Forms may seem basic and simple at first, but students will find they are actually quite difficult, especially if you are looking to develop speed and power through the movement.  Here's a quick description of what some of the classes are like.\n\nChi Kung - Shaolin Ba Duan Jin is the form of Chi Kung taught by Instructor Dao.  Emphasis in the first year of classes has been on abdominal breathing, the eight basic movements along with the variations, and to build awareness and sensitivity to chi in the lower dantian (energy store).  Intermediate classes emphasize directing chi flow during the eight movements and further development of sensitivity to chi in the dantian, hands, feet, and throughout the body.\n\nKung Fu Fitness - Classes begin with Shaolin warm up drills which are meant to develop coordination, flexibility, strength, and speed.  Warm up drills are mostly aerobic and dynamic.  They are followed up with stretching routines, which I've found to greatly enhance flexibility in a very short period of time.  This training has resulted in me being the most flexible I've even been in my 30 yr life (and I've been into fitness and conditioning since high school).  After stretching, static stance training is done to build core and leg strength.  An emphasis is also put on sensing and utilizing chi to support one self as opposed to using muscle.  All these drills together take approximately 25 min to half an hour.  The remainder of the class focuses on the foundations of kicking and punching.  The last few minutes of class are typically finished off with push ups and sit ups.\n\nKung Fu Practical - Classes begin 5 minutes after Kung Fu Fitness and usually begin with more advanced movements which typically involves a stance based kicking or punching movement.  The remainder of the class focuses on either sparring and application drills or Kung Fu forms.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis is my first experience with a martial arts school so I don't have a basis for comparison.  But I will say that I've thoroughly enjoyed myself in the past 10 months and that I would encourage anyone interested in trying Kung Fu or Chi Kung to try one of these classes.  Besides the obvious benefits of increased health and fitness, the atmosphere is great, the instructor is knowledgeable, and the training is fun.  You've got nothing to lose.","useful":10,"user_id":"xU02wVd4akbHrk8JiOdDYQ"}

My husband convinced me to rate it at 3 stars.\n\nLet's start with the place was dirty.  We arrived at precisely opening time.  Only one other customer there so far.  And yet there were crumbs under the table and splatters on the wall.  The walls are white.  You don't have to look hard to see these yellowish splatters everywhere.  IMO a person cleaning would have had to simply ignore them.    The table, plates, glasses and cutlery appeared clean (though the appetizer was served on a plate covered in aluminum foil so I could not actually see that plate.)\n\nNext, my beverage.  I ordered a soda.  Turns out it was flat, very flat.  And so once I got the waitresses attention she just says she thought there might be a problem with it.  REALLY?  Instead of testing it before bringing it out to a customer, she just served questionably flat soda?  That's ridiculous.  On the other hand, my husband got lemonade and it wasn't from powder or anything.  There was pulp in the glass.  He liked that a lot.\n\nAppetizer.  Just a simple Shrimp Tempura.  There were 5 shrimp for $5.95.  And they were small shrimp.  Usually for an order like this you get jumbo shrimp...  at other places anyway.  Ok, so the Shrimp Tempura I ordered came fried in a breading, NOT in TEMPURA!  Disappointing except for the fact that they were so crispy they made noise when you bit into them and the sauce was damned near the BEST sweet and sour (with a touch of hot) sauce I've ever had in my life.  \n\nMy entree was orange chicken.  the sauce was kind of barbequey-orangey.  Something new for me.  And It was really good.  Wish there was a better variety of vegetables besides carrots and onions.  The worst part of the dish was how long it must have sat before it was delivered to my table (there were only 3 tables filled at the time, so they were not busy.)  My fried chicken was soggy.  And soggy fried food is  gross.  So I ended up removing the fried bits and just eating the chicken without it.  My husband ordered Pad Thai, with a spice level of 4.  he said the dish was fine except the spice level was really low (more  like a 1.5.)  Because the place was dirty he didn't want to add any heat from the table... a little too questionable.\n\nMy husband said he would like to eat here again.

I paid like usual, and thank god when they gave me my dress and skirt I checked to see if it was just as gorgeous as it was before.\nThey had completely destroyed the back of my skirt and were going to let me walk out without a clue.  Not good for business.\nI questioned why the skirt looked super sloppy and the seamstress said that she knew she couldn't thread that certain fabric together but did anyway.  Then the owner comes up and tries to put my mind at ease saying that they would send it to another place to see if they could fix it, but that BCBG fabric was expensive and delicate so he didn't think they could.  They told me they would call me then took down my number again, and I left with just the dress I had dry cleaned.\nThree weeks later, I give them a call because they hadn't contacted me.  The owner answered and said \"oh yes I remember you, they couldn't fix it you can come pick it up whenever and get a refund\".... Well maybe you should've called me like you said you would.\nI go to pick it up, walk in and give the clerk my ticket- she grabs the skirt in the clear wrap on a hanger and says have a good day.  I said, \"I'm supposed to be refunded\" as I take the skirt out of the clear wrap.\nThe owner hears me and explains to the clerk I needed to be refunded because they had messed up.  I take one look at the skirt and immediately get upset over how it looks.  Instead of being neatly separated like it was when I brought it there (because the thread wasn't there to attach it), it was fuzzy, sloppy and completely destroyed.\nI ask the owner, \"what are you going to do to fix this, this was extremely expensive and you heard the seamstress say she knew she couldn't thread it with your machine but she had done it anyway\".  He replies \"you can take it to BCBG and see if they can repair it, I can't do anything for you\".\nMaybe if you want to keep repeat customers, you would pay for their clothing that your employee destroyed.  The skirt was $69 at BCBG, worn three times and now completely destroyed.  If i could give this place zero stars, I would for sure.

I said sure and started to step around the counter so they could measure the inseam and what not but she said that was not necessary and she could do it by eye....hmm \"ancient Chinese secret\" I presume; I gave her the green light for one pair of pants and was worried all week.  What I received was a beautifully hemmed pair of paints missing the Vegas street stains that had collected while I dragged them all over town. \n\nI ended up taking in all my pants for this treatment and have been similarly impressed every time;  I asked them to change a button out of one of my shirts and they explained they didn't carry that type of button but did recommend a few stores in town where I could try to find a replacement. Haven't done that yet but will be soon. \n\nThey also give you fee bottled water if you are a paying customer; I haven't been this happy with a dry cleaners since moving from Omaha.

The only good part about the experience was the drinks.  The Thai tea is great.  The food was okay but nothing special.  The decor needs a major update and the restaurant could use a good cleaning.  Someone needs to call Robert Irvine.  \n\nThe two things that make this place a 1 star review are the service and the price.  The service was some of the worst service that I've ever had in a restaurant.  We order three entrees and an appetizer.  After waiting about 15 minutes, our first entree arrived.  Somewhere in the next 5-10 minutes our appetizer arrived and then finally about 5 minutes after that the remaining two entrees arrived.  \n\nWe finished eating and had some food left over.  After about 10 minutes of the waitress ignoring our table, we decided to stack the dishes in order to get her attention.  Yeah, that didn't work.  We waited and tried to get her attention and after another 15 minutes we were successful.  We asked for To Go boxes and put our remaining food into the containers.  \n\nAfter receiving the check, I was surprised at how much the bill was for the meal.  It definitely was not worth the price.  At this point, I just wanted to pay and get out of the place.  I placed my Amex card into the card slot adorned with American Express logo next to the statement of them \"gladly accepting American Express\" to be told by the waitress that they don't take American Express.  I don't know if I was more shocked by contradiction in credit card adornment or by the fact that the waitress was actually at our table.\n\nI paid the bill, left a normal tip, since the waitress was hovering around cleaning the table as I tried to fill out the bill.  I then did a balancing trick with our takeout boxes since I wasn't afforded the luxury of a bag (maybe you need to spend more in order to receive a bag) and hurried out of the place with my family.\n\nI was excited to try a new place near our house but sadly the experience was lacking and I won't be returning.  Hopefully the next place we try will be better.","useful":1,"user_id":"UMuPg-8A1oJXqSrRsfxxIQ"}

They were pretty good and I ate there all the time.  \n\nUsed to being the important part.  \n\nA few months ago they broke from the franchise and renamed Meat Chix and Wieners.  Really?  Who calls a restaurant this?  I tried it out a few times after the change but today was the last straw.  We walked in and ordered the usual, 6 WIngs medium for me, same for my wife, Ranch and Blue Cheese dip, large fries to share and two drinks.  Well they changed their menu and no longer have medium sauce or Blue Cheese.  What kind of wing place doesn't have Blue Cheese.  My wife changes her order to a Portabello burger with onion rings, hot sauce on the side.  Almost $25 dollars later we sit down to wait.  \n\nAnd wait...and wait some more.  \n\n25 minutes later we get our order. Did I mention this is a cook to order fast-food place.  Orders used to come out at lightning speed, sometimes before we had even filled our drinks and sat down.  Not anymore. We were assured several times that our food would be right out by who we think was the manager.  However she grabbed her bags from the office that was set up in a booth in the corner of the restaurant before we got our food.\n\nAfter all that waiting you think they could at least get the order correct, right? Nope.  My wife got her burger with their trendy version of french fries that look like little more than thick potato chips.  No hot sauce, no onion rings.  I get my 5 1/2 wings (one was a mutant or from a baby chicken) , ranch and no fries.  She goes to cashier (the only person no working outside of the kitchen BTW)  and let her know.  A few minutes later we get the onion rings, but no sauce or apology.  \n\nThe food itself was OK, but again used to be much better.  The wings were small and thinly sauced.  The order of \"fries\"  was small and not particularly good.  My wife did say the Portabello burger was good.  \n\nI really wish I didn't have to write this, since the previous establishment had been so good and we went there often.

Now I've been to shooting ranges before, and they have been rather lame. They were all outdoors where everyone had to shoot and check targets together, you had the sun baking down and blinding you and there were a bunch of crazy old guys shooting off huge guns just to feel cool. Needless to say I had some pre-conceived opinions of how I was going to enjoy my time at The Range, but luckily this place blows any range I've been to away.\n\nIt's an indoor, air conditioned range where everyone has their own little lane with barriers on both sides. Since it's indoors and the targets are automated (think of the targets you see in cop movies and shows) you go at your own pace and don't have to worry about keeping time with everyone else. \n\nOne of the most important things to note about The Range is the staff. They were not only friendly but super helpful, and this is extremely important for anyone who is not familiar with handling firearms or with how a range works. My dad and I are both well-versed in firearm protocols, but since it was our first time there we were still made to watch the mandatory safety video. Anyone who doesn't feel comfortable after that is encouraged to speak with the staff for more in-depth rules. Also, if you just happened to go out and purchase a new gun and have no idea how it works, they are more than happy to walk you through it. Safety is the most important factor of firearms, and the staff is completely dedicated to making sure everyone stays safe by being easily approachable.\n\nAlso, The Range is very diverse in terms of who goes there. Rather than being full of a bunch of old guys there were groups of young guys, couples, families (I was surprised to see young girls handling firearms) and solo people all present and accounted for. Maybe it's a Southern thing, but you would NEVER find families (or even women) at a firing range up in New York. I think it's great, and I'm eager to come back and start introducing my wife to shooting. This is something I would never do at a range in New York, but I think she will feel very comfortable if we came here to do some shooting.\n\nNow let's get on to the pricing. To rent one lane for the entire day is $17, or for $25 a day two people can share one lane. If you don't happen to have a firearm handy or want to try out a new model before buying it, you can rent them right at the counter. My father and I rented a handgun and it was only $8, which isn't bad at all. Now here's where things get pricey. If you don't have your own targets and ammo, they do sell it there, but it is marked up quite a bit. We spent $11 for the same box of ammo we could have picked up for under $5 in the store. So if you're there for awhile and blowing through several boxes of ammo it can add up quickly. Same goes for the targets...they have a large variety of them but they cost more than they would in the store. All in all, my dad and I spent a little over $70 to share a lane with one gun, two boxes of ammo and a pack of targets. On the plus side, they will supply eye protectors and ear muffs at no additional charge.\n\nThe Range at Lake Norman is a great place to do some target practice, whether you're a pro shooter or have no idea what the muzzle of a gun is. If you are the latter the staff are eager to help guide you through this new experience in the hopes of not only making you a safe firearms user, but also to get you hooked on this fun sport/hobby. The biggest thing keeping me from giving the place five stars is the price...if you don't have your own gun, ammo or targets the cost can rise up pretty quickly, especially if you're having a great time and blow through ammo faster than you realize. I'll definitely be coming back here, and next time my wife will be in tow.","useful":15,"user_id":"46HhzhpBfTdTSB5ceTx_Og"}

My boyfriend and I thought we would enjoy a nice breakfast on our day off, but it didn't start out very well.\nI wish I knew the name of the short blond girl that was greeting but unfortunately I do not. Needless to say, she was incredibly rude. I am a very polite person so I held my tongue but let's just say she should be removed from any hostess duties and put in the back...maybe wash dishes or take out the trash. She led the two of us, with two menus and two sets of silverware, to our table and proceeded to ask my boyfriend what she could get him to drink...and then began to walk away. Are you kidding me???? And when she realized she had forgotten one of the TWO people she turned back with no apology and an attitude like it was an inconvenience that I was there. Not impressed with her attitude. A hostess should smile and be polite...she did not and was not. And to ice her cake...if you're going to be the person everyone sees when they enter the restaurant, take a little pride in how you look. Ugh.\n\nAnyway, the food was mediocre and could easily be made just as well, if not better, in your own kitchen. The sausage gravy was not impressive and my over easy eggs were not very well made and quite a bit runny. It's a good thing they give you a carafe of water because the glasses are tiny!!! The only reason that this review is getting 3 stars is because of our waitress, Adrianna. She was very nice and polite. Perhaps management should ask her to give some lessons to the short, sloppy, rude blond girl that was \"pretending\" to hostess today.","useful":2,"user_id":"uPRJ5lCMBaJabY5WlZNiAg"}

However I had always heard good things about Mimi so after cardio training/hill running at the Riverdale Park, about 6 other team members and myself decided to give the pho at Mimi's a try.  One thing to mention - if you have never ordered a fresh fruit smoothie to enjoy with your Pho, you are missing out.  \n\nService - we came at around lunch hour on a Sunday and the restaurant was about half full 30 mins after we arrived.  We had the most people in our group with 7.  2 people were working as servers, one was probably the owner.  Food took significantly longer than the expected (for a pho restaurant) to come out.  We had to remind them about our smoothies, which came almost after we were finished eating.  There was probably a 30 minute delay in between the first smoothie and the last smoothie (ordered 7)\n\nSmoothie - the mango smoothie was tasty, however it tasted like it was made from mango nectar rather than the actual fruit.  My team member had the avocado and said it was good.  Another team member ordered the jackfruit and said it was terrible with no flavour.  I had the sour sop and it was alright - it would have better if the flavour was stronger.\n\nSizes - Sizes at pho restaurants are a hit and miss. Sometime you get a gigantic bowl for a large and sometimes you get a bowl the size of a small.  At Mi Mi's, there is hardly a noticeable difference between the small and the large.  Many of our guys were shocked when the bowls came out.  In short, bowls are small - order a larger size.  \n\nPho - I tasted the rare beef and beef balls noodle.  The broth was very clean and tasty - not as oily as the soup at Train.  Noodles were fresh.  Tasted like what pho should taste like.  \n\nVermicelli with grilled beef and spring rolls (bun) - nothing that stands out here.  I've had better elsewhere  There was an interesting taste to the spring rolls.  Fish sauce was quite bland.  Unimpressed.\n\nOverall, I would come back for the Pho or try something else on the menu.","useful":0,"user_id":"-brdx3aTtQOMsRG5x9FxdQ"}

Upon completion, I noticed several areas that were peeling off. I expressed my concern immediately to the employee at my home and he said, \"It's normal and it will be fine when it dries\". Once the finish dried, I examined it further and found additional peeling, clumps, areas where the finish was applied over old caulking and areas where the finish wasn't even applied. Weeks later, a member of my household simply rubbed his hand across the sink bowl and pieces of the finish came off. (At this point the sink faucet hadn't even been re-connected yet!) \n\nWhen I repeatedly expressed my concerns over the poor quality of the work to Convertabath management, their suggested resolution was to re-spray the areas. (I assumed until their one-year warranty expired - then I was on my own!) When I requested a refund, they not only kept the $1,000+ from the poor quality work but also demanded $1,400+ for a job they hadn't even started.","useful":2,"user_id":"c5-OMRRYPf3eFEKA-LO5Wg"}

I approached the front desk and told the young man that the women's bathroom needed paper towels and asked if there was anyone who can maybe clean it up to make it look sanitary. He replied \"uh, well, the lady who does just came in so it'll be clean in a while.\" I thought that was fair since she just came in and I'll do my 2 hour workout. Once I was done I walked back to the locker room to take a shower, expecting that the place would be decent but unfortunately it wasn't. It was the same if not worse. The only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser. I saw the janitor literally sitting on the bench in the locker room doing something on her phone, which is none of my concern, but 2 hours since I was told someone was going to clean them and nothing was done?! That's pretty ridiculous. I didn't bother to shower there. Never again will I go there. If you don't mind it, fine, but if you'd like a clean place I definitely do not recommend it.","useful":0,"user_id":"nSLz1hlkiLz_fflqOR1jdA"}

There was no wait and only a few tables were taken.  I was seated promptly and brought water and coffee.  Both came in carafes, with a lemon (nice touch) slice in the water.\n\nI saw on the menu that their salsa was homemade, so I had to try the Southwest omelette.  Got it with hash browns (crispy) and sourdough toast.  Came out of the kitchen in about 5 minutes.  It was most excellent!  The salsa did not disappoint, with big chunks of tomatoes and spiced nicely.  Matter-in-fact, I got so wrapped around the salsa, I realized I didn't have any meat on the side so I asked for a side of bacon.  Had that on the table in less than 2 minutes.\n\nNeedless to say, the food was great and service was fast.  Coffee was fine, but not spectacular.  I feel like Jack Reacher when it comes to coffee.  He would have been satisfied, but not thrilled.  The water, on the other hand, with the lemon and a carafe full of it on the table, was great!\n\nI was going to sit at my table and type this review, but realized a line had formed and people were waiting for tables...all within 30 minutes of arriving.  It may be due to the novelty of the place, but to be on the safe side, get here before 8:00!\n\nUpdated on 9/12/15...I was a bit generous with my first review as I recognized there were growing pains this place would have to experience.  I've read the other reviews about rude greeters and poor food quality, so I came back this morning to see if I should change my rating.\n\n5 stars it was and 5 stars it is!  Even better than the first time.  The evil greeter was not there, the proud grandma was, and the food was outstanding!  Had the Ultimate Omelette this morning that couldn't have been better.

Prices aren't dirt-cheap (long sleeved button-ups were about $55) and are comparable to sale prices at the regular retail stores.  The best bargains are in the back, in the clearance section.

The greeter makes the 1st impression and she did a great job.\n\nWe had the same waitress as our first visit (Sherry). She was very busy but was still friendly + efficient. We had to ask for extra napkins and more creamer and she got those pretty quickly, within seconds. \n\nMy husband ordered a spinach-portobello omelette. For his side, he chose the fruit cup. For his bread, he chose rye toast. He loved the rye toast. The fruit cup was pretty small, and he was a little disappointed about that (see photo)\n\nI ordered the Smothered Bird, which was grilled chicken breast on a pretzel roll with Swiss cheese + green onions. The chicken was OK, a little bland. The pretzel roll was a little underwhelming, maybe because it was kind of soggy from all the grease. (This is why I had to ask for extra napkins. I think extra napkins should be a given, especially when someone orders a sandwich)\n\nI actually ended up ditching the pretzel roll and just eating the chicken breast with a knife and fork. The sandwich came with fries. The fries had a great texture, but needed more seasoning. I had to salt them pretty well. It also came with tomato slices, raw red onion and pickle chips. I only ate the pickles and they were great. \n\nI'm very happy there's a good breakfast spot in this town now.

I''ve tried my luck at nearly every chinese takeout spot in the East Valley, and I can definitively say the food at China Gourmet impressed me the most.\n\nPROS: Made from scratch.  Heaping portions at very reasonable prices.  Quality far exceeds expectations.  Single-handedly raises the bar for local take-out.\n\nCONS:  Made from scratch.  So the wait time is fairly substantial (20-25 minutes in my case). Doesn't look like much from the outside.  Very small, only three tables and no restroom. Definitely intended to be a take-out only kind of place.\n\nRecommendation: \nThe teriyaki beef was incredible, and not at all what I was expecting.  Instead of chopped beef in the thick teriyaki glaze I'm accustomed to, theirs was a thinner marinade that soaked completely through the meat.  Every piece was consistently tender and loaded with flavor.  I'd never had teriyaki of this caliber, and definitely didn't expect it from a little hole in the wall like this. Paid 8.95 for an order that could easily feed two with leftover.\n\nThe best, by far, was the hot and sour soup.  It put anything I'd tried previously to shame.  It was 2.50 for a quart, and short of Thai Chili's Tom Yum, it's the best hot and sour you'll find in the valley.  \n\nIf you happen to be in the area, it's definitely worth a shot.

There's a nice safe feeling about it, that even I, as a young, pregnant female, feel I'm in good company.\n\nI have to agree what another reviewer said about the bathrooms getting too much steam in, but I haven't gone to the bathroom there so it obviously hasn't bothered me.\n\nThe people at the front desk are half and half, and by that I mean you may have one that just sits there and talks to someone about sports for 3 minutes while you wait to tell them you are there to see someone (happened to me) or you have a super nice person who's just full of smiles, and completely helpful. Half and half, and I'm okay with that.\n\nThe location is super close to home, so it was perfect for me. The prices are pretty good as well.\n\nEach person I've met with has been very watchful over me being pregnant and my safety so that's really comforting.\n\nIt's not a meat market, like I've seen other fitness clubs as. (Puke).\n\nAll in all, it's a good clean place where people are there to work out, and you have the support you need, whether it be great work out machines, a decent staff, or a hot tub if you wanna just relax.

However, of all the places I have tried, which is nearly 15 in just under 2 years, Papaya Thai on University Dr. in Mesa is the absolute WORST! \n\nI am a HUGE fan of all styles of Thai Food. I've traveled throughout Asia on more than one occassion, taught English in China and spent years seeking out authentic eateries in the Asian-based areas of this country's biggest Metropolitan cities. Thai food holds a special place in my heart, but never have I been as disappointed as I was with my experience at Papaya Thai!\n\nIf Papaya Thai was worth the words, I would gladly go into more detail about the atmosphere, the menu and the quality-to-value ratio, as I do with my other reviews... \n\nHowever, there's really not much to say about this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall next to the Dollar Store. The service isn't worth the price of tipping, the food is as hit-and-miss as it gets and the owner couldn't care less if he loses a customer, which, judging by the fact that not a single person came in during the entire 45 minutes I was there on a Tuesday during prime mealtime, is something he must excel at! \n\nFor the record, I haven't sent a food item back due to an issue in over 4 years. Unfortunately, Papaya Thai effectively ruined that streak for me...and on their signature \"Pad Thai\" noodle dish, nonetheless! \n\nThe sad part is that what I got in return, besides a table-side confrontation from a rude, know-it-all cook (who told me I could not order the Pad Thai there anymore!), was even worse!!!\n\nSimply put, I won't be back. If the food was even half-decent, I would have gladly chocked the experience up to an unfortunate coincidence and happily given it another shot. However, only 1 of the 3 entrees we tried (a chicken curry dish) was even edible and the prices they demand are among the highest of all such restaurants in the area! \n\nThere are many, much better places in the area to spend your hard earned cash at if you crave the taste of Thai food! \n\nAvoid Papaya Thai!","useful":3,"user_id":"qrqmuWzML9drT74Y05XqTg"}

The people, the atmosphere.  People who gave amazing customer service, I let them know and I posted it online.  I also told the associates I was going to post their great customer service online for others to see.  They agreed and thanked me for it.  After all, there is so much negativity with places these days and as a business owner myself, I respect others who give all they do to the workplace they are in.  These days, it's hard.  So, I decided to try and do good for these businesses and associates that work there.\n\nThis one particular person, I will not mention names, as I am not that anal, like this person is. \n\nFirst of all, let's start from the beginning... I go to Bass Pro for the amazing things they have.  The merchandise is always displayed well and there are prices on everything.  There are many items in this place, you cannot find anywhere else.  The atmosphere, for the most part, is great too.\n\nSecondly, I take my son, or both my boys to this place.  During the summer they have camp days, so I go almost on a daily basis.\n\nSo, that one bad apple in the damn bunch, was friendly and we chatted about how her day was and some of the cool products the store has, etc.  I got the extended warranties for the items I purchased, after they explained... whatever.  The discussions is what most people would talk about with a cashier.  However, my son, who had a traumatic injury from a car accident when he was a few years old, was comfortable around this person, so that is the reason why when she was there, I went up to her.  I asked her if she was working with kids and she told me she was going to school for this type of work, etc.\n\nSo, I told her I really need to discuss something with her and that hope she will be with Bass Pro for a while and I have many connections in case one day she decides to go into her line of work, from some of the best people actually in the industry.  One is short staffed, this person could've possibly have gotten to work with my son, as it is hard for him to just go with anyone... who cares now.\n\nSo, I sent her a friend request on Facebook.... next thing I know a couple of weeks later the cops are at my door, with my wife and kids answering and I was coming home.\n\nShe told the police I am stalking her at work.  I am ALWAYS going to her till when she is working.  I friend reqeuested her on Facebook..... I am stalking her LOLOLOLOLOL  I only seen her a few times.  \n\nIF the store did a check on all the transactions I made, they will find all the different people I see.  Also, I say hi to everyone.  Whether it is the greeter in the front, or back of the store, the associates that do the camp outside, the ones who are giving boating testing outside, the cleaning lady... It doesn't matter... I am sorry for being kind and courteous and polite.\n\nHaving police offers at your house and explaining everything is not the most pleasurable thing ever.  Especially when it comes to girl / guy situations.\n\nThe cops, of course, said there is not much here to go by, just stay away from her.\n\nI am not just staying away from this paranoid headcase, I am staying away from the store, until an apology is issued.  I spent a crap load of money in this place,  If being kind and polite to people is wrong... what the hell is happening with society?\n\nShe is the reason people are afraid to communicate with one another.  I would hate to see any person run into her at night... she will be terrified.  Perhaps it's just me,  Maybe I am just too much of a creeper LOL  I was never told that by anyone.  \n\nIt would have also been cool, if the store manager knew about this, if they could of discussed with me the situation as I am there a lot of the times buying something with my kids or with my kids at the family camp days.\n\nInstead, I get two cops at my door, they paralleled parked at the end of my driveway and my wife and kids get scared as my parents are older and the night before things were hard for them and the next day this happens... THIS IS NO JOKE\n\nI would really like an apology before this escalates to the corporate levels at Bass Pro.  Many of your associates there know who I am.  If one person is going to have to spoil it for the rest of your store for an either misunderstanding, or just to fake everything and cause crap... right now I take option #2\n\nManagement can get back to me at gon_carlo@yahoo.ca","useful":8,"user_id":"RDkzmSbFjxfIpDAPhoFJxg"}

He asked how I came in the gym with out paying a $15 fee. I told him I simply told the guy that I was a guest and he let me in. He was pissed that I had gone and accused me of robbing him for attending the class without paying. If I had been told of a $15 fee before I wouldn't have a problem paying it but at this point I was really upset. I didn't want to pay it so he kicked me out of the gym.

It's a great little Mexican restaurant on Notre-Dame Street, ideal for lunch. To start, I've ordered the flautas (chicken or potato), which are served with queso fresco, red onions, radishes and lettuce as garnish. It's two per order and they are crunchy perfection!\n\nTheir speciality is the torta (a Mexican-style sandwich). I've tried the chicken, the steak and the vegetarian tortas. Surprisingly, my favourite is the \"Malinche\" vegetarian torta becauce the smoked mozzarella cheese pairs perfectly with the chipotle mayo, avocado, tomato slices and watercress. YUM. Each sandwich costs $10.95 before taxes. It's not cheap but I really enjoy it and find it very filling.\n\nDo not overlook that jar placed on every picnic table. It's filled with homemade, pickled jalapeños, which are a delicious addition to the tortas or quesadillas and bursting with flavour.\n\nI've also visited for breakfast on a Saturday - I thoroughly enjoyed it! Packed with flavour, my vegetarian breakfast quesadilla was delicious. Guacamole, pico de gallo, eggs and smoked cheese - what a winning combination! Their coffee is also amazing.\n\nThey also serve churros as a dessert option, which are delicious deep fried pastry rolled in cinnamon sugar.

The city didn't have many good options for breakfast until this place opened up a few weeks ago. \n\nMy first + only visit was this morning (Friday) at 9:30am. The restaurant is larger than I expected with plenty of parking spaces. There was a very short wait (maybe 2 minutes) for a table. The gal who took us to our table was NOT friendly. She did not smile once. (I watched as she took 3 other groups to their tables. Not a single smile or friendly expression. One family asked her for a high chair + she made a disapproving scowl. She is the reason I did not give this place 5 stars. I don't know her name as she didn't wear a name tag, but she's a young, thin brunette who had her hair in a bun.)\n\nWe ordered coffee + ice water. Each comes in its own carafe, which was nice. The table is supplied with salt, pepper, Heinz ketchup, Frank's Red Hot Sauce, various kinds of Smucker's preserves + marmalades, cream + sugar. The creamers were International Delights half + half: plain, hazelnut and French vanilla. \n\nOur waitress was Sherry, who was MUCH nicer than the greeter. Her name tag said \"Proud Mom, Proud Grandma\" which was adorable. I wish I had time to ask how old her grandkids were (she looked too young to be a granny) but she seemed pretty busy so I didn't bother. \n \nWe ordered a spinach omelette + a pastrami Reuben. Both were great! Portions were large and food was yummy. The omelette came with salsa that was very good. It also came with toast + potatoes (you can substitute with fresh fruit) The sandwich came with fries (you can substitute with soup or salad for 99¢) The fries were OK. Not too greasy, but not spectacular. \n\nMost menu items are $7 to $9. Coffee was $2.29, I think. \n\nThe food did not take very long to come to the table, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. While we waited for our food, we enjoyed using their FREE wifi. The wifi signal was strong + fast. \n\nOur waitress Sherry checked on us a couple of times, which was nice. \n\nOur bill came to $25 which wasn't bad for the quality of food. A little pricey for everyday dining, but good for an occasional breakfast treat. They offer their full menu (breakfast, brunch, lunch) all day but their soup of the day wasn't ready when we went. I believe they close after lunchtime. \n\nOverall, great experience. Loved the food and the waitress. Not happy with the greeter. (If a business wants to make a good first impression, they need to have a friendly greeter!)\n\n(I posted a few photos)","useful":0,"user_id":"ZlMOsCT9T8TON1TtkIWzvg"}

I love fish sauce in my stir fries but in a soup it left me a little confused.\n\nEqually confusing was the fact that there is yet another Vietnamese restaurant in the east end using the wrong spring roll wrappers for their spring rolls (Bach Yen is the other one). However, I do have to admit that the filling is pretty good.\n\nMy partner in crime ordered some seafood noodle soup and it was loaded with Pepto colour faux crab sticks (it's common to have faux crab this type of soup but just not in such an abundance).

Bruce cut my hair. He was friendly and professional. I love my hair, so when I try a new place, I'm nervous. When he was done and I had said some prayers (I was not facing the mirror so I didn't know what the cut looked like until he was finished) I was pleased. The real judge was my wife. She said it was the best hair cut I'd had in years! If that wasn't good enough, the price was just 15 bucks. You can't beat that in this economy.","useful":2,"user_id":"na1ZD7bFvAUHXiV61CrCDw"}

I found a CPO vehicle (1-owner, just off lease), with the best price for similar cars nationwide (just above USAA and American Express certified prices).  I contacted the dealership after hours via email, and received a prompt response in the morning.  I brought my own financing, and was able to secure the deal over email/phone within a matter of days, and picked it up in less than a week.  The dealership is beautifully decorated (Mercedes...nothing less would be acceptable), and the shop was immaculate.  My client advisor (Shea White) was always available, and the finance manager was on point.  No forced sales or \"rust proofing\" shoved in my face, which is exactly what I wanted.  The entire sales team were professional and courteous throughout; everyone that passed by me while waiting seemed cheerful and offered a \"how are you?!\" even though they had nothing to do with my purchase.  Even when I returned home and realized a pretty significant oversight on the used car that I had just purchased, the staff went above and beyond to \"make good\" and really demonstrate how committed they are to customer service.  Any other dealer could legally have flipped me the bird and moved on, leaving me appropriately with no legal recourse...but Hendrick Motors did a fantastic job at not only reassuring me that I had made the right decision, but ensuring that they had a repeat customer for life.  For the record, I didn't even buy a Mercedes from them, and they treated me with nothing but professionalism and respect.  \n\nGreat Job, Hendrick Motorsports.  My only regret is that I live so far away from Charlotte!  The next time I'm in the market for a luxury vehicle, they'll be my first stop.\n\nTo those of you perusing the reviews and reading the other 1-star complaints...I would take them with a grain of salt (eg. completely disregard) and give them the benefit of the doubt.  I went in with the attitude that if ANYTHING felt wrong about the sale I was going to walk out the door and buy another cross-shopped BMW down the road.  I had no reservations with giving them my business, and encourage you to do the same if you're in the market.  Do your homework and come prepared.

I picked up a piece and almost all the breading slid off the chicken leaving a oddly square shaped piece of chicken. The breading (when it stayed on the bread) was overly seasoned. It actually overpowered the chicken itself. I'm just disappointed and will have to find a new place to get good chicken fingers. Everyone working in the restaurant was super nice.

Well, as you you might have gathered from some of the other reviews, it's a flatbread native to Naples and environs.  It's cooked up fresh on a griddle and is then used to envelop some savoury fillings (meat, cheese, greens, etc.)--kind of like an Italian wrap.  \n\nL'Artisan Piadineria has too many toppings, too many options, for my liking.  Scale back the menu and go with straight-up hits, would be my advice to the management.  My advice to you is to go with one of the daily specials.  Also, think juicy.  The flatbread itself is pretty dry.  It benefits from a choice of fillings that is going to be both a tasty and a juicy combination.  Unfortunately, many of the options on the menu aren't going to deliver on that promise, but, then again, many others will.

Instead, there is only the molded plastic NOT RECYCLABLE takeout containers. \n\nI ask for the bio option, they are out of stock. I email customer service and ask why with all this commitment to environmental concerns etc, why would such a large retailer even use non-recyclable takeout containers? Then I ask if possibly the issue is customer education. Can they put a sign at the biodegradable containers? Maybe people are unaware that the other choice is not even recyclable. \n\nI get some email back about Longo's moving towards all corn based plastics with no definitive date.. and no answer to my follow up email. \n\nThis is a grocery store that Styrofoams and shrink wraps a bunch of bananas.

They came out to spray the faux granite on our shower and bathtub in Feb 2014. We had problems right off the bat when many little spots peeled off. Since we were still under warranty the first year, they came to respray those areas. Then after the year, more peeled off and the door wouldn't close correctly. They decided the hinges were defective and needed to replace the door. They charged us 75 dollars to respray peeled places and then also wanted to charge us 75 dollars to go pick up the new door. The company that made the door said that was pretty crazy and gave us the door without the extra charge. Then about 6 months later, more places started peeling off. Also, the places they sprayed the time before were darker than the rest of the shower pan. They wanted to charge me again 75 dollars to respray. I had to talk with the owner and send her pictures. She wouldn't respray the peeled places (3rd time) without the 75 dollar charge but instead said that they would come and respray the whole shower pan because of the color discrepancy. The worker came and did a good job. However, within 4 days another place peeled off in the same area. I called back immediately and sent a picture. You guessed it, they wanted to charge me 75 dollars to fix it and said they didn't touch that part. I told them I would wait until more peeled off and then would call back. To which they replyed that I should check my paper work because waiting until the situation got worse would void my warranty. REALLY? COME ON! \n\nI so wish we wouldn't have gone with this company. It's been a year and a half and we have had nothing but trouble. They refuse to make things right and say they are doing nothing wrong because it's all in the contract.

So we eat here all the time.\n\nLocated in a busy strip I saw others going into the Salon and Yoga place this morning while looking for parking.  At peak morning times it can be a challenge to find a parking spot.  The inside is laid out well.  Light pastel colors on the walls with decor.  Bright colored plates on tables.  It's warm and welcoming.\n\nThis morning I ordered the Westgate skillet.  The description reads \"Spicy chorizo sausage, jalapenos, green chiles, onions, homemade salsa and a blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses.\"  Anything that has cheese in it here comes loaded with cheese.  I swear I ordered this once and it easily had a pound of cheese on it.  No joke.  So I ordered it with light cheese.  That was perfect.\n\nThe chorizo has the consistency of Taco Bell ground beef.  The jalapeño, green chiles and onions with salsa taste like it came out of a can.  I ordered 2 over medium eggs that come on top.  Underneath the chorizo mixture are home cooked potatoes.  Those taste like the frozen bag variety.  \n\nWater and coffee are served in a pitcher and carafe.  Service is quick and friendly.  Everything arrived promptly and hot.  No issues there.\n\nOverall this place is just OK.   The food quality lacks what I've experienced at other top notch breakfast establishments.

The sales agent went above and beyond to help us, after a leak came about while they were remodeling our shower. However, after spending nearly $1,500 I CAN'T say that I am satisfied with the end result. I have uploaded photos for you all to see the quality of work from ConvertABath. If it were a school grade, I'd give them a \"C-\". My husband and I examined the shower together and we discovered unfilled holes, uneven/crooked framing, and the corners don't meet up. (Again, Please see the photos that I added.) My husband called ConvertABath to let them know that shower was crooked and asked if they could send someone out to take a look at the shower. They had the secretary call us back a few days later (TODAY) and she told me that they viewed it on the photos that they took after they remodeled it, and that they couldn't do anything about it, because our walls were crooked. So basically, it's just going to have to look a mess, because \"our walls are crooked.\" I'm not a contractor or handyman, but I'm 90% sure that their measurements were just off with the pieces and they just did whatever they could to make it fit, instead of just reordering a frame and glass that would fit properly. Prior to their work, our frame did not appear crooked at all. It may have had a little rust and calcium build up, BUT the framing was NOT crooked. And I can't not forget that the main reason that  we decided to get the shower redone was because of the small holes and cracks inside of the shower. There is still an unfilled hole. You can also see the indents from where the other holes and cracks were after they \"refinished\" it. Overall, it was a poor job and I feel like they did just brush us off when we tried to let them know about the quality of their work.

That means: today there will be a class of muay thai, but no kickboxing, tomorrow there is a class off kickboxing but no muay thai.  Forget the mornings. They only offer Hot Yoga and one other aerobics class.\nIf you like martial Arts esp Muay Thai:  join \"Krudar\" on Spadina. Boy o boy are those guys determined. every instructor is built of pure muscle and flexibility.\nXtreme Couture just sounds good, nothing else.\np.s  Don't waste your money if u enjoy martial arts classes.","useful":8,"user_id":"Lu3R-B7HZB9l5-4RXO-kTA"}

I went because I saw their trucks around campus and I LOVE empanadas so I thought I would give it a try.\n\nThe only reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 was because the people there were SUPER NICE and the restaurant itself was REALLY CLEAN. Which are both positives. Unfortunately the empanadas themselves were kind of flavorless and not that great. The bread part wasn't flaky and was kind of waxy to be honest. They have a really limited selection as well--pretty much just beef, chicken and a vegetarian option. None of the potato and cheddar or even the dessert ones that you get at a place like Manolo's near Canopy. \n\nI wouldn't come again.

Once we acclimated to the range, our target set, we struggled with loading the weapon. Adam came in with an automatic thingy that helped us load the bullets swiftly. Now we were set to shoot. While Adam gave detailed instructions to my shooting partner, I listened intently so that he wouldn't have to repeat himself over the bullets propelling into targets. Once we were over the sudden shots being fired, we were able to settle down and get in some practice. I actually shot very well, according to Adam and the other two patrons.

It's more of an upscale corner store right off the Yonge-Bloor station with a below average sushi station, average hot food station and an absolutely KILLER salad bar.  \n\nIf you live in the area and need fresh produce for a decent price, you're better off going to the many Rabba's that are in the area (I think there are three or four).  Also, fruits and veggies aren't super fresh and I kind of expect that from Longo's.  Combine that with their expensive prices, the grocery section is more a 2/5.  \n\nHowever, if you are looking for an upscale, custom made salad, skip Camros and come here.  It's a bit expensive (2.99/100 g), but the selection is amazing.  It's surprising that the salad bar can be so fresh, yet their produce section isn't.  They have all the regular greens, but also have tofu, string beans (love 'em!), boiled eggs, fruits, steak served cold, shrimp, really good salmon, etc.  So for quality of the salad bar, definitely 5/5, but it loses a star for price.  4/5\n\nSo for a quick, fresh salad and if you are willing to pay - come here.\nYou want affordable fresh groceries? - skip.","useful":3,"user_id":"pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w"}

The food is made to order, so we had to wait a bit, I'd say about 10 minutes.  Food was piping hot when it came out.\n\nMy wife had the corn dog bites, which were ENORMOUS and only $8.

Also good with ranch, or my favorite, classic yellow mustard.  On the side, the wife had cottage fries.  These were a little overdone and crispy, which I like, but she doesn't.  These were probably the weakest dish of the meal, but were still solid.\n\nI had the bourbon bacon cheeseburger and onion rings.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium.  I feel like a lot of places these days ask you how you want a burger cooked and then cook it medium well no matter what you say.  Not MCW.  Very juicy and flavorful.  The bun was a soft sesame seed bun, which tastes good but loses something in structural integrity.  I had to finish with a fork, but that was fine, it was a fantastic burger.  The patty had a nice crust, and was juicy to the end.  Lots of bacon and they use a nice cheese.  I would order this burger again.\n\nThe onion rings were unlike any I've had, I would describe the better as almost funnel cake like.  It was light and very crisp and had a bit of sweetness.

This location on the other hand is dirty, unfriendly, and unprofessional. \n\nThe parking lot always has multiple shopping carts that have caused minor damage to parked cars. Once you enter the facility, front desk personnel are usually occupied with something else, so your not even properly acknowledged. This location was remodeled six months ago, but now you would never be able to tell. Good luck locating dumbbells because they are staggered throughout the entire facility and never placed back on the appropriate rack. No one cleans after themselves, so once their done with a machine its covered in sweat with their weights still in place. There will be people who walk around with their shirts missing and some attempt to exercise like that as well.\n\nThe worst part of the facility is the locker room, which smells horrible, the mirror is never wiped, and the bathroom seems to have water all over the place. I The steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now. Once you enter this area you feel that you need a shower because its so filthy. The drinking fountained are whipped with some strong scented chemical that is over powering to drink from. The water is usually warm and gross because they want you to purchase bottled water.\n\nI am amazed that this location has wonderful group fitness instructors that are truly professionals in their field. I strongly recommend the Zumba class, but be aware if you attend these classes you will more than likely feel uncomfortable and harassed. The group fitness class is positioned, so your back is facing out to the workout facility. As, you attempt to exercise there will be men standing at the window smiling, blowing kisses to you, or I have even seen someone use their phone to video tape these women. Everyday there is multiple people sitting at the abdominal crunch machines drooling as the class is in session. (Watch out for the older black gentleman with cornrows who always wears a wife beater and huge headphones because he is the worst offender.) Once I brought this up to a manager he ensured me that he will take care of this issue, but its now been two weeks and nothing has changed. \n\nDO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION!","useful":2,"user_id":"qqb88fjHNJHRy3nJuUcA6g"}

I even called him out on it and said \"you seem upset\" and I explained why I couldn't let him in earlier (yet he still came in at 7:45 am ). He back peddled a bit but the damage was done.

The place looks like a converted Burger Chef (or some other take out/drive through establishment) and is staffed by employees who seemed, at best, disinterested.   The menu is more or less a series of numbered pictures of prepared plates and the brain dead patrons (myself obviously included) order by advising the counterperson of which numbered picture they desire.  Foolishly my wife, thinking like an American, requested some rather minor and reasonable variations to her order and asked for one item a la carte.  Well, the response we got from the counterperson was a look of both disdain and confusion.  I could not figure out if the counterperson was ignorant, unwilling to assist an English speaker, completely unable to deviate from the ridiculous pictures, and/or all of the foregoing.  As for the food it was mediocre at best.  I could live with the mediocre food, it was the \"tooth-pulling\" experience of ordering that was unacceptable.  Best to steer clear of this place and if you need a little \"nosh\" while in the vicinity of the Namur Metro Station try Dunn's Delicatessen next door and give Amir a wide berth.","useful":0,"user_id":"G2nkpCQipxtyjpGG9f2xTA"}

When asked about the wrong preparation about dishes, I was told that's the way they do it. No remorse until the end when the chef offered more crappy food as an apology.

I hoped to get smooth work boots that would be multipurpose.  \n\nThe staff helped me fit my boots and said that they would stretch, so the snug fit was appropriate.  Unfortunately not.  My big toes were bruised from the boots and my friend suggested I take them back; she had done so before and said they treated her well.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the store, I explained what had happened.  The young, sullen girl at the cash register informed me that there were no returns, especially after being worn.  I showed her the receipt and the clean, unscuffed boot.  I was not happy that I had spent close to $100 for a boot that didn't fit due to their staff's advice.  I asked for the manager.\n\nHe came over to me and was extremely disagreeable from the start.  He towered over me and spoke in an extremely patronizing fashion.  His explanations were inconsistent; he said that his staff would have felt the toe and not allowed me to buy a boot too small.  He insisted that he had trained his staff himself and everyone was experts with this.  \n\nI went with a staff member to look at larger boots and he was completely hands off.  Stood at least 10 feet away and asked me how they felt.  He also had me feel the placement of the toe and would not do so himself when I asked.  I then went to speak to the manager and point this out.  The manager used his height and his voice raised to an angry tone as he denied the inconsistencies.  I became upset and asked him why he was treating a customer badly and he replied \"If you think I'm a prick now, you haven't seen anything yet.\"  \n\nI took my small boots back with me and did not buy the other boots.  I did return another day with my friend who frequents Cowtown Boots.  We were met with frosty silence by all of the staff and they would not call the manager for us.  \n\nI will NEVER go there again and am shocked and disappointed at how rude and unprofessional all of the staff was, especially the manager.","useful":21,"user_id":"9RJ6bPuuSzq6VmIMO-Awag"}

Especially since I found out about the large lLED ornament house and just had to go and take a look and bask in its architectural beauty (what a cute engineering wonder).  It's a very popular draw (and gimmick ;) ).\nMy, have times changed and was I ever so smart that I went on a weekday.  No rowdy or packing crowds, bright detracting spotlights, ugly vendor tents, and best of all, you could ride on the horse carriage ;)\nThey advertised that they bedecked 1.5 million LED lights on many trees that covered 16 blocks, beginning with Murphy Park and including some at Catlin Court.  I was only interested in viewing the lights on the trees and seeing the tall Christmas tree, meeting the horses, and getting my caricature drawn and not the vendors, music/dancers, and other form of entertainment (weekends only) necessarily.  And, I already met Santa Claus for this year @ Scottsdale Quarter.  So, I was already caught up ;)  I enjoyed taking great photos of the event without those tents (or balloons) in the way.  Besides, if you miss or regret something, there is always next year and the next and the next.  This (free) event is a nice place to walk around with your significant other or out-of-town families or friends.  I like the slight laidback vibe that the park influenced on me and other visitors, who were polite and all-around a joy to be at the event with.  I'm sure it's because of the weekday ;)  Make sure that you not only visit the main square (where tall vintage-y clock is at), do venture a bit north to Catlin Court and take in the lights that bedecked the lovely and preserved cottages & bungalows that were staying open after their normal hours for the event.\nI didn't ride the horse carriage ($25 up to 6 people- eek) and instead, chose to spend $10 on a b/w caricature of my ego self wearing a Santa hat by caricaturist Gary Drysdale.  To me, it's like a postcard ;)\nThe (small) event will stay lit 'til January 7 from 5 PM - 10 PM.  I advise that you go before it gets pitch-black out and before the crowd turns up and so you can get beautiful dusk shots.  And, don't forgot to take a whiff of the leaves on the ground, which reminded me of home back east...\nI may visit again in the future- especially if they decided to add SNOW :)","useful":3,"user_id":"bfCyqpNNOL0tO5TmlHOxAQ"}

The renovations didn't touch the original exterior arch, or the balconies and moldings inside, so it feels completely ghostly and the sound is warm, resonant and lovely as only old spaces seem to be. The gentle rake on the floor, and a second level with lots of room for bar, coat check, merch, means that even if they don't open the balconies visibility is great and there's a feeling of comfort and movement. The lighting inside is beautiful and not garish (can't say the same for the flashy Virgin logo on the new sign outside, but if they are paying for it's survival I guess I can forgive them the vanity plate.) \n\nAlso - 4$ Rolling Rock. That has to be the best beer option and price point at any venue of this size in the city. Speaking of size, total capacity is about 800. ~500 if you just use the floor.

I would come back here for sure! \n\nAtmosphere - 3/5\nTaste - 5/5\nPortion -5/5\nPrice - 6/5\n\nAtmosphere - the sign our front is scribbled in italic cursive red on a while background. There are a few large plants from the window and you can tell this is an authentic Vietnamese food. As you walk in, you can see the restaurant is long and narrow with about 20 to 30 seats. There is not much use of aesthetics on the wall.\n\nTaste - I ordered a chicken and porkchop on rice dish with shrimp roll and avocado milkshake. The rice dish came with chicken broth soup as well and it was excellent. The porkchop was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth with a savoury finish. The chicken lacked taste as it was thicker so perhaps not as marinaded. The shrimp roll was ok and usually I look forward to the peanut sauce but this one did not taste like peanuts. The avocado shake was beautifully presented with two pieces of strawberry on the top. It was missing a bit of sugar but I also tend to have more of a sweet tooth so I think this would have tasted perfect to others. \n\nPortion - I definitely ordered with my eyes than my stomach. I was too full to finish all my food. I had a piece of the shrimp roll, some soup, and finished the porkchop but not the chicken so now I have lunch for tomorrow! \n\nPrice - $12.50 for the rice dish, $4 for the avocado shake and $4 for the shrimp rolls. Pretty good value for what you are getting.","useful":3,"user_id":"omYTOVB-NEYOaWPOQcBNYw"}

Instead of using beef, pork hock and pork red they only use lean beef, and the meat portion is poor.  The broth has flavour but I've definitely had better in Toronto.  Goi cuon on the other hand is average and sauce isn't too memorable.  Kudo to them for not using MSG as I don't feel minor migraine after the meal.\nHaven't been here for while but I can tell they've built a solid fan base in this area as patrons here seem to be mixed in ethnicity.

The manager, thinking out loud, thought she might bring the scale back out.\nFiguring the manager followed through, we tried one last time. Same thing! I ordered a 2 scoop.

She came up with several ideas that helped really bring the concept together and make it a cohesive and beautiful day. And her florals are UNBELIEVABLE! I received so many compliments on her work! She and Erika were both very responsive throughout the process and recommended vendors where I needed them and were great about giving feedback on what I needed to be doing and when. \n\nThe wonderful Erika helped orchestrate the timing of the day and make sure everything and everyone knew when it was supposed to be happening.

I get what they're trying to do, and while certainly more festive than year-long Glendale, it's alright. I'm not gonna ask for a refund for all $0 I spent to get in.\n\nThey say 1.6 millions lights, but there's no way that doesn't include the generic white lights on the trees. In fact, even with the impressive square in the center it's still 90% trees, as opposed to free standing lights. You'll recognize where you want to be with all the vendors interspersed throughout, but they do have a side section with inflatable attractions and a Santa photo op.\n\nI agree with some of the others, the stands are mostly fair food. There's a clear line with AZ State Fair pricing and menus, but in the square it's mostly some kind of sweets. There's crafts here and there, but nothing that I felt was brought in just for the festival, just for Christmas, etc. I think the stands should be more local or more festive if you're gonna do this.\n\nIf that's not your thing, you ride your donkey or eat your spirally potato. If you're in the area, I'm sure it's not a bad thing to do with the family for the holidays.

Nasty.\n\nThen we were ready to go, and had to go to the register because no one would bring us our check.

So the bottom line is that the service was terrible, they tried to keep my clothes and lied about having them. Definitely won't be going back there again.

His holistic approach to healthcare is nothing short of amazing.  Dr. Santo is a wealth of information and he has contributed greatly to my gaining a deeper understanding of the whole mind, body and spirit connection.  He takes into account your diet, lifestyle, any stresses, and environmental exposures.  Finally, a doctor who really gets it!  \n\nIt's so refreshing in that Dr. Santo actually listens to you so as to properly diagnose and arrive at the proper treatment.  His methods of diagnosis and evaluation really lend to treating the underlying cause rather than the conventional approach of just treating and suppressing the symptoms by prescribing a drug.  While I understand that drugs are sometimes needed or necessary in some cases, I do believe that if a natural cure or remedy exists then it's best to go that route initially.  \n\nOverall, Dr. Santo's approach to health is one that encourages and works in harmony with your body's innate ability to heal itself.  He's so knowledgeable and informed on the need for proper nutrition, the use of nutritional products, vitamin and mineral supplements, and acupuncture, all of which contribute to restoring and achieving optimum health.  \n\nHis therapeutic methods are so very healing, relaxing, calming and beneficial.  I can't sing his praises enough.  I didn't even know it was possible to feel so much better.  I thought I was doing pretty well, but there's always room for improvement and with knowledge comes power - when you know better, you do better.  So, now I know and I feel such a level of improvement in vitality, energy, and peace.  I'm so very grateful to have Dr. Santo's guidance.  Dr. Santo is amazing and I highly recommend him to anyone looking to improve their overall health and well-being.","useful":1,"user_id":"cddFOUADc9QsS1wmp8ADkQ"}

In the winter it seems to do well amongst the snowbirds, and it also appears to be busy with takeouts and deliveries.  So much so that in-house diners are neglected, but I'll get to that in a minute.\nMy son's girlfriend loves a Thai place on the other side of town, and he asked to go there.  I had just battled 45  minutes of traffic coming home and the last thing I wanted to do was get out and do 30 more minutes in traffic hell, so I suggested PaPaYa Thai, which is less than a mile from my home.  This place has been open in my neighborhood for years, but I've never been there before.    \nWe were greeted by a distracted hostess, who was also our waitress.  There were maybe three other tables with customers. There is some nice Thai memoribilia on the walls.  There's a couple of huge fish tanks with some gorgeous fish, but the rest of the decor is  firmly set in the early 1990s.  \nWe were seated promptly, and between taking care of the other tables, the ringing phone and take-out customers we were waited on.  To start we ordered the sampler appetizer--chicken satay, fried tofu, spring rolls and rangoon.  It came nicely arranged with two tasty dipping sauces.  The satay was meh, but the other three were delicious.  A woman (owner/manager?) came out from the kitchen and asked how we were. I had high hopes....\nMy son had ordered chicken pad thai, and I ordered the pork.  I know, it's the most mundane thing on a Thai menu, but I figured I could order something more adventurous the next time.  For spice level I asked for about 1 and 1/2. Son asked for 2.\nHis arrived first, then mine came limping out a few minutes later.  His was ear-burning, eye-watering hot.  Mine had not a speck of spice, in fact the overall taste I got was sweet.  His noodles were nicely cooked, the chicken tasty.  My noodles were so overdone as to be mushy, and the pork tasted a little gamey, like maybe it was a few days past prime.  Son enjoyed his.  I ate about four bites of mine.  No one came by to ask us how things were going, if we would like more to drink.  I asked my son where our waitress was, and he matter-of-factly said, \"Oh, she left to make a delivery five minutes ago.\"  \"Ha,ha,\" I said and he replied no, she had zipped out carrying a few bags of food, hopped into a car and took off.\nEventually owner/manager came out, asked if I wanted a box, then distractedly ran up to help another takeout customer.  The check eventually made its way to me, then eventually we got rang up and we left.  No goodbye, no thanks come again.  So we won't.  \nWould I recommend this place to a friend?  Maybe for takeout.  The apps were good and my son enjoyed his meal.  But hit or miss from a woefully understaffed place (really? sending the only waitress out to deliver while she still had tables? Good grief!) isn't worth the forty bucks I spent.  I should have battled the traffic to eat at the place across town.","useful":0,"user_id":"0nLbvrTcoZY-OpppywtE0g"}

I did not, as I am very spoiled and like camping at home, in my house, with the A/C on - but I know that some people like it. TONS of local breweries come out for this festival and offer unlimited samples on Saturday, and you can vote for your favorite brewery! Food trucks were just up the hill, I don't know if this is the norm as this was my first time attending. A little out of the way, but not a pain. There are booths with local crafts and goodies too, if that's more your pace. Bring lots of sunscreen, as the festival takes place in an open field on Rural Hill grounds, and there's some (but not much shade). Or you can hide from the sun under one of the beer tents. Rural Hill is gorgeous, I'm glad this festival went so well this year as I know that they've been struggling with keeping events on track in the last year.

It's one of the two places in the city that you can find a 17\" cast iron skillet and the only place that sells it for less than $100. \n\nI came here for said 17\" cast iron skillet but after seeing the size of the damn thing, then realizing the 15\" was $30 cheaper, I went for that option. For $30, it's worth the sacrifice. And really, what the hell am I cooking that's going to be 17\" wide?\n\nI found it easily (the big hanging signs to mark out the sections REALLY help). \n\nThe thing I REALLY love about this place is how they make everything look super rustic.

On the phone they discussed the big pieces of furniture in our apartment, the floor our apartment was located on and the type of housing we were moving into.  That is when the manager gave my husband a quote for $90/hr for two guys and a large truck.  We appreciated how timely the response was, the ease of getting a quote, and the manners the manager had while working with us.  We booked them  quickly because that was the best deal we had been given.  \n\nPre-moving day: They called 4-5 days before our moving date to confirm our appointment and asked if we had any questions.  We appreciate this courtesy.  \n\nMoving Day: Our movers showed up 15 minutes past our scheduled appointment time, however, we honestly weren't too concerned. Part of the reason we booked this company was because they begin their money-clock as soon as they arrive.  Being tight on money, we decided to start bringing boxes down to where the truck would be loaded two hours prior to the truck showing up.  This would take leg work away from the movers so they didn't have to do the stairs 8 million more times.  The two men that were with us had very quiet demeanor's.  They both were polite and worked along side my husband and I and our two friends well.  Half way through the moving process the movers were getting to some of our bigger, heavier furniture. One mover had asked both my husband and I individually what our quote was.  A person helping to clean my apartment heard the two movers talking while the rest of us were taking a lap down the stairs that they were upset that we were under quoted.  They said that this should have been a three man job.  Honestly, in hindsight, I don't blame them in the slightest - it probably was a three man job.  Although, they made that slight slip when they probably thought they were alone, they maintained face and worked through the move.  They wrapped our stuff up nicely and made the job look easier than I know it was.  Moving in to our new place went by very quickly.  The men took direction well and worked through any kinks that always come with moving furniture.  \n\nDamage: We did have one piece of furniture that fell apart.  They were quick to point it out to us. They took pictures of the damage.  Thanks to their insurance and our agreement they will be sending someone out to see if they can repair it (it might actually be repairable, I think!) or they will be replacing it.  Again, we don't place any harsh fault of this on anyone - this stuff happens!  We just appreciate it being taken care of! \n\nRating: I have given this company 4/5 stars because I feel like the office needs to find a different way to quote their customers.  Reading these other yelp reviews it seems like that is a reoccurring issue. My movers would have received 5/5 but I will vouch for them in this instance that they were probably jipped.","useful":0,"user_id":"4WcxA3F_OqVEa_Gbad16gQ"}

My lovely wife and I spent the worst dining experience we could remember over the past 27 years. Now where do I begin.... Ordered Chicken Satay and Fried Wonton for appetizers. After 23 minutes, the wontons appeared. They were fine. When they arrived I complained about the 23 minute wait. The waiter then went into the kitchen and passed that on to the chef. \n\nIn the 23 minutes it took for us to get our wonton, they filled a 6-entree order to go and the couple near the door recevied their entrees. Note, there were only 3 tables occupied. When the satay arrived it was not grilled and not on bamboo stick as described on menu. It was fried.\n\n10 minutes later I got my BBQ-Chicken which was not bbq, but stir fried and had to ask for sticky rice. I calld the waiter over who said he couldn't help right away since he was busy w/the other 2 tables that had customers. When he arrived I questioned the preparation of the satay and my bbq-chicken entree. He then went into the kitchen and talked shit about me. \n\nI then confronted him and the chef and they had nothing but lame excuses about talking about us behind our backs. When asked about the wrong preparation about dishes, I was told that's the way they do it. No remorse until the end when the chef offered more crappy food as an apology. Reason she came out was since the waiter was now on a delivery run and she was alone, yes ALONE in the restaurant to do everything.\n\nMy food was poor. My wife's was unispired.

I came here to get my maid of honor dress for my friend's wedding altered here and dropped it off almost a month before the wedding.  First round of alterations, they needed to hem the dress, and take the waist in, they needed 2 weeks to do this and when I went in for the next fitting they had to losen up the waist area and alter it another inch.  They told me they needed a week and a half and that I could come in on the Wednesday before the wedding and if at that point any alterations were still needed they would be done on the spot.  Come Wednesday, my dress is not there and neither is the seamstress.  Owner tells me to come the next day (day before I leave out of town for the wedding) and the dress does not fit my hips anymore (literally can not move my legs) and was hemmed 2 inches too high.

Food came out in waves the first person received theirs about 10 minutes before everyone else.  We added chicken to the entree and it had a whopping 4 slivers of meat that I had to hunt down for the up charge.  I my pad tai chicken tasted more of a ketchup/barbeque base and i have no clue where that came from.  The others ordered curry dishes and they had mentioned that they were ok at best..\n\nI went home and I complained of stomach pains and gas.  When we woke up the next morning my brother in law was complained of similar discomfort the next day at 3 pm.  It is really the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nI;ve been to restaurants i did not care to revisit and chose not to review at all, this one topped them all.  I am glad to see they have some good reviews from others, maybe try what you were doing when you were serving those people.  It must have worked but I did not see it.\n\nTips for the business:\nClean the heck out of the business, top to bottom, wall to wall. Hire a professional.  Bad aroma is the first thing people taste.\nRemove the bacteria curtain, its fowl.\nMake the staff more friendly and conversational- not cold. They can be suggestive to people that have never visited.  \nSample items leaving the kitchen to stay on top of your game in cooking.\n\nI have been to quite a few tai restaurants and will not name names on this review. one in mind has all these items.  I will drive to Scottsdale in the future and pay the same for the higher quality and better experience.","useful":3,"user_id":"6Rn42PynBwnoTge-LUz73w"}

I am in the customer service industry and have worked in the auto industry for years and if there is one thing I am a sucker for it is customer service. Please know that this is my 17th leased vehicle and have had not so memorable experiences.  \n\nMy buddy purchased an M4 acorss the street and BWM and while I was with him to pick up the vehicle I decided to pick something up myself. I was able to negotiate a deal but had to practically beg the sales person to call me back to the point of stating \"I'm done with you\" which prompted an immediate call back of course. (I will post my 1 star review for Hendricks BMW soon). My Wife currently has a Mercedes and requested I stop by the dealer just to see what the have prior to picking up the BMW. I did so and saw some vehicles I liked. Spoke to Izik and told him the entire story. \"I have a deal at BMW, these are the terms, I prefer BMW but here to see what you can offer.\" They ran some numbers for me and could not come close to matching the deal ($200 more) . His manager Gantt came out and gave me the song and dance about safety which is completely true but stated I'm about the numbers and will only consider it at the same price or better. 5 minutes later he comes out and matches the deal which was a clear losing deal. I drive the car to my home to show my wife and she was not crazy about the color. Gantt then spends the next 2 days trying to locate the perfect car for me and ships it over without question or increase in price. Once we arrived Itzik had the car inside the showroom with a bow to surprise my wife which worked very well I might add. I then went into finance which is normally the worst part. I did judge a book by it's cover when I met Daniel and expected this to suck! This is normally where your payment jumps because \"your credit is not what you thought\" or \"you need 2 more oil changes for $9,345\". Daniel, went through the entire process and I declined all stating that I could not afford more then I agreed to. I then braced myself for the JERK mode but never experienced it. Matter fact, it was the total opposite. This guy is awesome! I left his office with some home made food and making jokes the entire time. By the time I left this place I had my hands full of gifts and food, Not from the dealer but of people I dealt with.  \n\nAmazing is an understatement when it comes to describing the customer Service here. So much so that I am now debating 2nd deal with them this week. Gantt, Itzik and Daniel must have run 30 different scenarios with whatever weird request I can come up with, with no hesitation at all. Itzik was in constant communication with me and I felt as if he was working for me rather then me begging for his attention like BMW. Customer Service to the point where they told me to just grab whatever car I was interested in and enjoy a night out on the town. I did not call there bluff on this but I did take it for a quick spin and fell in love a 2nd time. \n\nThe entire process was beyond perfect and as long as I live in Charlotte I will only be buying cars from this team moving forward. Thank you Itzik, Gantt and Daniel for for all your help and making this experience memorable.","useful":1,"user_id":"716HhYuM8WdCQZZ9ReMveg"}

I am guilty of reading reviews before we arrived there and had a preconceived notion of how the experience would go. \nI was pleasantly surprised! \nWe were there to buy an Acura MDX. An under 40,000$ vehicle. Based on other reviews I wasn't sure about the attitude we would receive based on the fact that we weren't spending 75,000-150,000!\nEverything from beginning to end went smoothly. We mainly dealt with Dave and Luke. \nDave was very friendly and helpful. Luke was friendly as well.\nMind you, we already had our financing in place before we arrived and knew the exact car we were getting. \nThe only variable was our trade in. They offered us the right price and all was set into motion!\nWhile we waited for all the final details we just hung out in the waiting room/ children's room, as we had our 5 year old with us. The dealership offers snacks and drinks which was nice. My daughter enjoyed watching TV and playing in the kids room.\nWe had a nice tour of their top notch service department. We didn't encounter any high pressure sales or attitude for our less than fancy purchase. Lol.\nThe dealership seems well organized and knowledgeable.\nTest drive went smoothly. \nThey offer a nice gift bag with your purchase. \nJust thoughtful little touches all around.\nIf I am ever in the market to buy a Mercedes- or any other car for that matter- as they have a selection of other used vehicles as well- I wouldn't hesitate to go to this dealership again! \nPretty painless!\nI should mention that upon meeting Dave- the salesman- I told him I would rather be getting a Pap smear than buying a car( based on how I thought the experience may go according to reviews I had read). Yep- totally classy. \nIt all went uphill from there! Dave handled it like a champ.\nSO! All in all I am very happy. \nI love our MDX and Hendricks Mercedes!","useful":0,"user_id":"sKXi8UgFbRUc6fgwQvVqYg"}

And have trained with numerous firearms on countless ranges.   Having retired from the military and settling in Cornelius, NC, I wanted to keep up my shooting skills by practicing at a local range.\n\nAfter visiting The Range at Lake Norman (TRALN) numerous times over a six month period, I have no desire to go back.   There are several reasons that I based my opinion on.   \n\n1.  Safety.   Safety training consists of a five minute video.   Period.   They have ONLY one Range Safety Officer on-duty at a time (for 15 shooting lanes), and sometimes the RSO spends their time chatting to friends and customers.   I have been swept more times by newbies at TRALN, than I have been by the enemy in combat.    I felt like I needed body armor to shoot there.   The problem is exponentially worst whenever TRALN has a GroupOn offer.   \n\n2.  Price.   It's expensive to shoot there.   TRALN charges by the hour, when most other ranges charge by the day.\n\n3.  Ammunition restrictions.  TRALN does not allow reloads, personal or factory, with the exception of sub-standard Atlanta Arms reloads that they happen to sell.   They also do not allow bagged or canned ammo.  Their pistol range is limited to only total metal jacket (TMJ) ammo.   Rental of a firearm requires you to purchase name brand ammo from them.  You can't buy Atlanta Arms reloads for their rentals.   According to TRALN, Atlanta Arms reloads are good enough for your firearms, but not theirs. \n\n4.  Guns and gear.   TRALN has an excessive amount of firearm inventory for the space they have.  So much so, in the display cases, they have to stand the pistols up on end, side by side, to where the customer can't tell what they are looking at and have to ask for assistance to see anything.   And there is an unusual fascination with Kimber firearms by management.  Optics choices are scarce and most of it, is on the low end of cheap.   A prominent brand is NCSTAR.   Really?    For some strange reason, management thought it was a good idea to sell gun-related jewelry.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?   And as expected, everything is expensive and overpriced.   BTW, Do not bother asking for them to special order a firearm, because they'll take your order and it will never ever come in.   \n\n5.  Gunsmithing.    It's non-existent, unless you simply need a screw turned or a firearm cleaned.   \n\n6.  Knowledge.   TRALN employees are hired \"off the street\", with limited or no firearm knowledge.   And the phrase, \"If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit.\", seems to be the company's mission statement.   \n\n7.  Facilities.   The partitions between shooting lanes are too small, you will be pelted by spent brass from the shooter to your left.    And all shooting lanes are limited to 25 yards.   The building is nice and generally clean.   TRALN needs to be proactive with it's maintenance, which seems to be an afterthought.    Shooting lane(s) have been unavailable to use, for days, due to broken target delivery equipment.  The floor paint is peeling and worn.     \n\nTRALN \"success\" is mostly due to limited competition and an ignorant clientele.   As new shooting ranges open for business, I suspect TRALN will struggle to stay in business.","useful":2,"user_id":"a1PFAAn3vtlBv3ehU5xNFQ"}

Scallops were very small with a few large shrimp, but the sauce again was very, very dark and too strong for a seafood dish.  I think they use the same sauce on everything and just add a little sugar or pepper flakes.  Ordered a shrimp eggroll which was good, but had one large whole shrimp in it rather than being diced and distributed throughout.  The crab rangoon I think is just cream cheese.

And we're not even fisher/hunter types! There's something in here for everyone! \n\nAnd there are some good prices, too. We were helping out Santa here (there were also at least 2 elves in the store), and we got a remote control car for $28.00. YES, Canadian $$! They also offer baseball caps from $5.00 to $8.00 - ok so some of them advertise the shop itself, but that's still a good price even though it's a novelty. Men's watches were on sale for $15.00. TONS of fishing gear - unBELIEVABLE selection - from clothing to rods, reels, knives, anything imaginable that you could possibly use for the sport of fishing! Take a gander at their fly-fishing section; all kinds of feathers and weights, and tackle boxes - all at great prices. I was thinking of scoring one for my beads, but I don't want to get carried away... I had to remind myself that I really do not have time to take up a new hobby at this stage in my life, but taking up making flies for fishing was very tempting!\n\nBut it's the décor that really really got to me! This is a taxidermist's dream! There were all kinds of bears and deer, stags and does, fish, moose, and at least one buffalo - and they all appear to be real (ok, I touched one; it seemed real to me!) There's a fortune in wild animals in this shop, none of them for sale! The eyes are all agog as you look around - there is always something new to see. Natural light filters down from the ceiling, in this shop that is 2 stories high in the center.

The location of Rural Hill was a great selection for them because of all the open space it provided for people to move around. It's remote location and many acres let people pretty much have the run of the property and you didn't get that somewhat kettle'd in feeling that the Octoberfest can bring on. The food vendors they had were pretty limited with there only being a hot dog stand, hamburger stand and I believe a BBQ stand but amazingly enough they didn't seem to run out of food (while we were there) so if you wanted to grab a bite to eat there was at least food to be had. There was also the music/bands on the main stage but I'd say about 80% of the attendees were only there for the beer tasting. They seemed to do a very good job of representing a lot of North Carolina Brewers and there were probably about 12-14 tents up handing out the samples of sweet hoppy deliciousness. \n\nI gotta get on to the reason I only gave this event 3 stars though and that is because of the poor event planning that seemed to go into this with regards to being able to accommodate the large crowd they had. My friends had prepaid tickets and I decided I would just eat the additional 5$ charge and get my ticket at the gate for the beer tasting. We probably showed up at around 130 and the line for tickets was at least 150 people deep. They seemed to do a pretty good job of moving the line along but mid way through a woman came out and announced that they were no longer selling tickets for the beer sampling because they were afraid the beer vendors would run out of beer. Right then and there many people just peeled out of the line and went on their merry way to other probably anywhere else the could get a cold draft. With my friends already inside I was pretty much committed to the event or else I would have up and left myself but I figured what the hell. I'll just pay the 20$ and claim designated driver rights so my friends can have a good time. Once inside it was amazing to see the lines at the beer tents. They were probably at least 100 people in each line and moving rather slowly. I tagged along with my friends as they hit each of the tents in succession. The vendors would give you a small plastic cup and for your sample you'd have probably 4 ounces. Nothing unreasonable there or anything you wouldn't expect for a beer sampling but after you had hit one vendor you would have to immediately go to the next line and begin your wait all over again. From what I could tell they probably needed at least double the number of beer tents to support the number of people they had in attendance. We ended up leaving after the last of the free tastings came and went and by that time most of the beer vendors had packed up and left because they ran out of product to hand out. Oh yeah, and the first keg was kicked probably around 3pm and that just added to the other lines becoming longer. \n\nOverall, it is a great idea for a event (weather permitting as always) for people who like to get out for a beer tasting. I'm sure the promoters will rave about it being a roaring success but when you have people being turned away at the gate or having to spend 30$-35$ just to stand in line all day it comes off as kind of \"ehh\". Until they get a better handle on how many people will be in attendance and scale the event to suit everyone I'd say it's a flip of the coin on whether or not you should check it out. \n\nLastly, mad props to the Lonerider folks. They seemed to have a endless supply of beer and their staff was keeping the cups topped off and line moving as fast as they possibly could.","useful":2,"user_id":"M6olJVnPF00VnRDdigWrJw"}

In retrospect I would only use this as a short term solution.\n\nThe other thing to know (and this IS in the very fine print) is that you will no longer be able to use your soap trays or any suction-cups on any treated service.","useful":3,"user_id":"oRrZqvADpuvgcOiWfGPeYA"}

For others it may be a hefty price to join. I came here for a wedding last weekend and it was lovely despite the rainy weather condition. \n\nAlthough the saying is if it rains on your wedding day, the couple must be blessed with luck. I remember this because the same thing happened on my wedding day. The country club is so beautiful when you walk in, you have the valet parking then go through the double doors and there's like a coat check in (if it were winter time) and key check in. Then proceeding those doors is the country club with the beautiful centerpiece table. On the left is the ballroom for wedding receptions and this one was magnificent. The family went all out with the tables decked out beautifully with only the best centerpieces and chairs covered with black linen.\n\nOn the right is the country club amenities for those who are members. Proceeding those doors is the area where members typically dine, complete with a full bar. Outside is the gazebo and beautiful golf terrace overlooking the country club, no wonder this couple wanted to get married here. I would have as well, except I'm not from this city! \n\nSo the wedding I attended was a traditional Jewish wedding, much like mine except with minor differences. I didn't get married outside and I didn't get covered with a holy cover. As well as having 5 or 6 groomsmen and bridemaids, my family doesn't do that. So there are some differences but to each his or her own. \n\nPro: I liked how organized this place is. You come here and the wedding planner tells you to pick up your card and wait till the ceremony begins. Then you wait outside or in, in our condition it was inside due to the rain. We waited out the rain and oh my god the wedding was super beautiful at 9 PM. It's like God blessed this couple to have the most beautiful outdoor night time wedding I've ever seen so far. The chuppah (Jewish wedding tent, the bride and groom stands under to get married) was so beautifully decorated with the best local flowers. The lighting was beautiful. \n\nFrom there we proceeded to the main reception area where the bride and groom shared their first dance, I believe it was Etta James, At Last. We had awesome waiters, who made sure our drinks were always full and plates as well! The music was the couples selection, but still nice. We enjoyed the photobooth outside as well, had some good clean fun there. \n\nThen proceeded on our way home at 1 AM when the wedding was over. Although as my husband claims the best thing was served, the sliders!  \n\nSo if your looking a a very nice and posh venue space for a wedding or corporate event look no further than the Beechmont Country Club located in Beachwood, Ohio.","useful":3,"user_id":"e7oFhe6690ucxKwzkwS49w"}

The only reason I gave one star is because giving no stars was not an option. My sister booked with this company to celebrate my sisters' 21st and my 30th birthday. The party bus was supposed to be the main attraction. She booked the Girl's Night package for $700(8 guest total) that was supposed to include party bus to the Rio hotel, tickets to see Chippendales, and VIP passes to Voodoo. I had no Idea that our actual time on the party bus would only be the 10-15 minute ride from our rental to the hotel only to arrive and be told once we got there that we needed to tip the driver (advance notice would have been nice). The Chippendales show was nice but it was definitely for an older crowd. The kicker of the night was the \"VIP Passes to Voodoo\", there was nothing VIP about it, first of all admission to the club was free for ANYONE who walked by, and even if it wasn't  free for anyone the bouncer didn't even have my name on the list but since it was eight females he let us in anyway. There were no incentives to this \"VIP Status\". Only to get up stairs to the actual club and its nearly empty and the people that were in attendance were of a way more mature age. I was highly disappointed in the services we received considering the price I paid. All I wanted to do was treat my sisters for their mile stone birthdays and I was left looking like a fool, I truly felt swindled. I literally could have called two Ubers and bought the tickets to the show separately and saved about $500. I'm glad I opted not to pay the extra $150 for them to drop us back off at the end of the night. This was a terrible way to begin my trip to Vegas.

My only complaint on that is everything is small packages and I have a large family - wish they had a volume discount if I bought 4-5 packages of some meat.

I love the ability to try new vegetables I wouldn't otherwise try, and I look forward to the weekly recipes.  I also love the extra products that I can odd to my order (i.e. non fruits and vegetables).  Many of them I cannot get at Loblaws or Metro, so can only get on the rare occasion I can make my way down to Whole Foods - so this is a huge convenience for me.  \n\nOf course there have been times where a produce item doesn't meet my expectations (e.g. you cut into apples and they're brown inside), or where they missed sending an item, however, I have found their customer service has dealt with it promptly and with pleasure, and they always either credit my order or provide it in the next delivery.  \n\nContrary to the review below, I have found the opposite with time-dated items.  They always have sufficient lead time before expiry.  On occasion they have sent me yoghurt with an expiry date very close to the date of receipt, HOWEVER, they pro-actively email me before sending the order to let me know this, and still include it in my order without any charge.  \n\nI will continue to use and recommend FDO.","useful":0,"user_id":"9nk02in9hJoQnEHibZUPmQ"}

Rusty told me to come in and he'd take care of me. Within minutes of arrival, Rusty was testing the battery in my vehicle and then replacing it. Which was amazing that he didn't make me wait for one of his other techs since I had an appointment to get to. Once the battery was in, my vehicle didn't start and he immediately reassessed the issue and found a contact had to pushed down just a bit more and I was completely back in business. I don't know if he realized I was in a rush or what, but I went in to settle the bill and he said there was no charge.

The employees wear uniforms and have an air of professionalism.  That is about where the pros end and the cons begin.  \n\nOn this visit, the owners were present.  I cannot think of another word besides snobbish.  As a first time customer inquiring about an upcoming event, they were both over the top arrogant with a bizarre defensiveness in their tone of voice.  One even said her son considered joining the event but is so far beyond it he decided against participating. What is that supposed to insinuate?  My husband and I compete in many shooting events of all different calibers and varieties.  We would never go so far as to assume ourselves beyond any event.  i just wonder if they remember they are hosting the event at their location.  Anyhow, if you have a vested interest in an event it might be wise to promote the event and drop the ego.  \n\nThe range has very specific rules about ammo.  Fine.  Their re-manufactured ammo (which cannot be shot through their rentals by the way) is required for the event.  So then sell it to me. We belong to a private club on the other side of town and want to try out your required ammo before shooting the event.  Why selling it to me posed a problem, I don't know.  But hassling me about it is not the solution.  It is also not the way to get me to return for future purchases.  The attitude towards those who choose to reload their own is palpable too but I guess misplaced shame is the game used to make customers buy the inhouse reloads. C'est la vie...\n\nOverall, the veneer does not hold up to the bourgeois attitude and poor customer service approach.  It is one of the places where if you are not immediately recognized, the owners and the employees are likely to treat you like some illiterate vagabond off the street.  They assume not only the ignorance of their clientele but also their own superiority.  I prefer to make purchases from people willing to look me in the eye...not look at me down their noses.      \n\nI guess we will stick to the private clubs filled with people who have a bit more perspective and a lot less attitude.\n\nAs an FYI, since we have already paid for entrance into the event, we have to go back.

That has never bothered me though\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that their eyelash glue wasn't very strong. Meaning my lashes would fall out quicker compared to other places I've been too. My friend was able to fix this issue as she researched a stronger glue and she brings it and asks them to use it instead. \n\nThe RMT massage -\n\nShe asked if I wanted a relaxation massage or deep tissue. I asked for deep tissue and she provided a great massage. I never needed to ask for more pressure (I like A LOT) of pressure. She focused on my problem areas which was much appreciated. I felt very knotty on the back of my traps for sometime. With the 60 mins, she put in good work. I think I'll come back for 90 min next time.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that there is a single massage room and a double massage room. I liked the privacy of the single room, but wouldn't mind the double if I were with a friend. They do provide an RMT receipt for insurance purposes. My claim went through perfectly. \n\nThe value of both services I've tried were on point. Every time I visit, they're always running some promo. The price point is always good, so I want to try more services from them. I also like that you can call or text to book services.

They have a number of vegetarian items, so if you don't eat meat you'll be able to have a meal here no problem. They have a large seating area with space outside in the warmer months, and like I mentioned before, they do delivery.\n\nWe had a little get together chez nous tonight and ordered in some platters of mini items a few days in advance. When the order arrived we realized that they had forgot to send an extra order of hummus and one of garlic sauce (which is super garlicky, not a good idea on a first date). So we called them back, and they didn't even bat an eyelash, they sent the sauce right over with a huge bag of pita bread. It might not seem like a big deal, but that was a nice touch. \n\nI didn't realize no one else had reviewed this location since it's so popular and right across the street from a metro station, but maybe next time I'll remember to take pics?","useful":4,"user_id":"Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A"}

I booked with this company to celebrate my sisters' 21st and 30th birthday. The party bus was supposed to be the main attraction. I booked the Girl's Night package for $700(8 guest total) that was supposed to include party bus to the Rio hotel, tickets to see Chippendales, and VIP passes to Voodoo. I had no Idea that our actual time on the party bus would only be the 10-15 minute ride from our rental to the hotel only to arrive and be told once we got there that we needed to tip the driver (advance notice would have been nice). The Chippendales show was nice but it was definitely for an older crowd. The kicker of the night was the \"VIP Passes to Voodoo\", there was nothing VIP about it, first of all admission to the club was free for ANYONE who walked by, and even if it wasn't  free for anyone the bouncer didn't even have my name on the list but since it was eight females he let us in anyway. There were no incentives to this \"VIP Status\". Only to get up stairs to the actual club and its nearly empty and the people that were in attendance were of a way more mature age. I was highly disappointed in the services we received considering the price I paid. All I wanted to do was treat my sisters for their mile stone birthdays and I was left looking like a fool, I truly felt swindled. I literally could have called two Ubers and bought the tickets to the show separately and saved about $500. I'm glad I opted not to pay the extra $150 for them to drop us back off at the end of the night. This was a terrible way to begin my trip to Vegas.

I first came here with a friend several years ago for her bridal gown fitting and even from then on, I sensed a lack of good customer service.\n\nNow that it's my turn, I decided to check out the same place and was helped by someone named Vira. I came with my future MIL at 7pm on a Thursday evening. Vira failed to ask me what my budget was until midway through my appointment and she had already given me a bunch of dresses to try which was way higher than what I had wanted to spend.  She was so unprofessional and ruined my wedding gown shopping experience that day. She didn't really seem to know what she was doing or how to effectively communicate with others.  I also tried on maybe 15 dresses and she seemed to have trouble understanding what I was looking for after I and my future MIL explained to her multiple times about the style I wanted. For majority of the appointment, she wouldn't let my MIL look for dresses for me and told her to sit down instead. Eventually, my MIL stepped in and found a couple of dresses that were more appropriate than what Vira had originally showed me.\n\nIn addition, this sales person was condescending and kept repeating that I could make changes to the dress and add or remove fabric here and there. Excuse me, but I'm here looking to BUY a dress, not DESIGN my own dress! At one point, when I told her I didn't like something about a dress, she said \"You're not a child, but I've told you before that you can change this.\"  Look, I'm the type who needs to see the actual dress on me to really know what it looks like. It's hard for me to imagine what it COULD look like by removing pieces of fabric and altering it significantly. I'm not going to buy a dress and then make all these changes and realize that it doesn't actually look good.  My goal was to find a dress with as little trouble as possible but this lady was causing me so much unnecessary stress. BTW: I was told that alterations are $450 flat rate.\n\nAlso, this whole \"no photographs\" rule is ridiculous. How are we supposed to know how we look in photographs?! I understand that some people take advantage and post a bunch of photos of wedding dresses online but taking ONE photo of a dress that I really liked wasn't even permitted at all. Also, nobody was around.  This rule certainly caused them to lose my business.  They really should change that because all of the other comparable places I've been to have allowed it, or have been lenient when they weren't as busy in the store (when I went, I was the only one there). They have a large selection of dresses but most stores carry very similar dresses, so that's why I'm not afraid to write this review before I actually buy my dress.  I'm definitely not going back there.\n\nThe sales person was also very pushy in the sense that she expected me to buy the dress right away after my first day of trying on dresses. As I was leaving, she was saying that I had to order it NOW because it won't come until March--blah blah blah...It's July 2016 and my wedding is in June 2017. I'm pretty sure I didn't need to buy it on that particular day.","useful":8,"user_id":"8P2LkzPGV4ID_fE7gJGKGg"}

Most of the previous issues I brought to light have been resolved one way or another, and the management team seems to be keeping a more diligent eye on what's going on here. It's still not perfect by any means, but I just want to be fair and recognize that this place has gotten significantly better over the last few months.","useful":0,"user_id":"srwBMvKnNy-tow3_LMaTog"}

The white dog isn't people-aggressive, it's dog-aggressive. Just the other day, I walked out of the elevator when that dog was on the ground floor. As soon as it saw my puppy, it tugged at its leash and let out a vicious snarl that I've never heard come from a dog before. It legitimately sounded like it wanted to kill my puppy.

It was not the first time I had attended a boxing facility. I had been boxing for a while prior so I had experience, but wanted to try Xtreme Couture because I thought they had exceptional coaches. I thought wrong. In fact it was one of the worst experiences I had ever had with a boxing gym. \nI can not comment on the quality of the other combat sports they teach, but I can comment on the boxing and fitness. Both of which were terrible and over-priced.\nThe fitness area frequently had equipment that did not work for long periods of time. A few weeks, usually.\nThe boxing was abysmal. The \"coaches\" did not seem to be very knowledgeable of the sport. Often attempting to teach outrageous techniques to hide their lack of knowledge. None of them knew the rules of the sport, which is something that coaches should know.\nTraining their boxers involved throwing them into a class, quite often mixed with beginners and doing repetitive drills, again likely to cover-up their lack of coaching abilities. Classes are for beginners. Competitive athletes need independent attention. \nI improved little while I was there. As a matter-of-fact, after finding a better coach, my new coach had to \"fix\" the damage that the Xtreme Couture coaches caused.\nIn addition to all that, I had prepaid for 24 sessions of one-on-one coaching, which was useless, but they didn't honer all of them. They still owe me four sessions, totaling $300. I left because, despite the terrible coaching, I was removed from the team. Their excuse was that I had been \"suspended\", but after doing some research I discovered that it was not true. Therefore, cancelling my membership was not my fault and i should have had the $300 refunded.\nOverall, do not take up boxing at Xtreme Couture and definitely do not prepay for personal sessions.","useful":0,"user_id":"NMx12qi0SLxLThk_tVxl2A"}

With that being said, I have eaten at Scramblers about seven times and decided today was the last day I dine there. While the food is good and the people are friendly enough, the service is poor. The wait time is generally too long (especially for breakfast items,) and the order never seems to be correct. It's honestly hit or miss. My experience today was frustrating. It was not busy at all. I ordered eggs Benedict with the eggs cooked well done and a side of bacon. Roughly 15 minutes later, the waitress bring out three plain poached eggs and the bacon. I thought she had listened to my order. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I let her try one more time. Second try-eggs were runny. I asked he to bring me the check so I could pay for the coffee. Instead, I waited longer still-for her to bring out the third attempt (which I didn't want.) At that point, I was so ready to leave and explained I didn't want the meal anymore and just wanted to pay for the coffee. I've had past experiences there where the soup was cold, the eggs were runny (both for me and my friends), and the orders were incorrect. With all of this being said-I will not be going there ever again. It's just too expensive of a place for the waitstaff to mess up orders. Plus, I like getting my food promptly. My tip is to ask the waiter or waitress to REPEAT your order back to you! People hear, but seldom do they actually LISTEN.","useful":0,"user_id":"JJZs5uWvpuqx6L1cEJxyyg"}

The staff is very friendly, Derrek in particular,has has taken great care of us and any random requests/questions that have come up. The apartment is very nice with some premium finishes. They provide everything you need to clean your shiny new appliances and extra paint if you need to paint over some thin spots on the walls. To that point the paint is a little thin but they know that and cover it free of charge! My only negative would be there seems to be a lot of residents that don't pickup after their dogs so sometimes there are droppings throughly out the complex. That being said Jefferson has recently had a crew cleaning the complex regularly so take that into consideration. Also it doesn't really seems like the breed restriction is enforced so you may see larger dogs around. Over all it's been a great experience. My favorite amenities are definitely the clubhouse, resort style pool and access to a dog park.

From there I receive communication that the discount will be emailed shortly. I present my phone to him to show that I have received the initial communication, I'm just waiting on the pin to come through.

Today was a little off, however, overall we always have a great experience. \n\nThe Great -- Scramblers has a ton of different options for both breakfast and lunch. The best thing about the \"griddles\" (pancakes and french toast) is that it is bottomless, so you can get as many as you want. However, the portions are pretty big, so usually you only want one. Surprisingly, their fries are really good as well, if you want lunch, you will have really good fries. The one thing I really like about this place is that you actually get bottomless tea (and coffee) -- meaning, they don't just give you one tea bag and as much water as you want; you actually get unlimited tea bags! Plus, they always have a seasonal flavor of coffee, and flavored coffee creamer. \n\nThe Good -- The food is good, however, it is your average \"chain\" quality. Some of their menu items (bacon, burgers, and pancakes) are really good, however, other items (oatmeal and biscuits and gravy) aren't anything special. Don't get me wrong, they are not bad under any circumstances, but there is nothing extraordinary about them. However, we have never had any issues with the food, and they are really good about getting food to the table in a very reasonable time. \n\nThe Could Be Improved -- Today showed us that there is room for improvement in service quality. We had a party of 4, and they put us at a table that could not even fit our order. I wouldn't be mad if that was the only place, however, there were plenty of parties of 2 at a 6 person table, whereas, we (and another party of 4), were elbow to elbow -- that was extremely frustrating, and required us to inhale our food to make room for others to eat. Another issue we had was I had asked for some butter for my oatmeal, and our sever never came back with the butter. By the time I got my butter, it was about 15 minutes after we had gotten my oatmeal, so it was cold. Luckily, I was able to talk to a manager, and they got me a different bowl of oatmeal, with everything I had asked for. \n\nIf we did not have the issues with the service, I would have been able to give them 5 stars; however, they weren't as busy as they usually are, and it was upsetting that the service was they way it was. However, they have good food, and great variety.","useful":1,"user_id":"9hmAKVRfY7Vw_tOJ_3P8pg"}

It was the third strike, should have known better, shame on us. Ugh, where to start, my better 2/3'rds wanted curry, we opted to try something different and went with pineapple beef curry. Spice level he wanted low, so we went with a level that was supposed to be a two. It was a twelve. The only flavor we could get from it was heat and we love and can tolerate heat but this was supposed to be a two, if there was no heat however, there would have been zero flavor so angry butthole it is. It was full and over populated with onions, never had this in description on menu and he hates onions, we literally got out a strainer and strained the curry sauce over the under-cooked rice so my poor love could at least not whither away. The beef, well, wheres the beef? There was supposed to be some beef, there was two small corn flakes of beef. At this point I wish we had just done Corn Flakes and milk for dinner because it would have been better, waaaaay better and more flavorful. He ate two tablespoons of curry and made a darn frozen dinner from freezer, that bad. The spring rolls, oh the spring rolls, there was no dignity nor pride in manufacturing theses monstrosities that were wrapped looser than a two buck whore. Absolutely terrible. Even the peanut sauce sucked and lacked flavor. I actually asked for fish sauce instead as a substitute but they apparently don't listen so horrible prideless peanut sauce it was. \n\nOh for the grand finale of this horrible, tasteless, lackluster dinner....picking up the order. Gosh, I walk in, there is five other individuals waiting for their orders to deliver. Yes, Door Dash, Grub Hub, Uber Eats etc...you get the picture. They are all pissed because they had been standing/waiting there so long to deliver completed meals that were just chilling, yeah, getting cold on one of the tables waiting to be handed over so they could be delivered for over twenty minutes.

Then a co-worker recommended it to me as her family's go-to pizza place. She told me about their favorite cheeseburger pizza and mentioned that they also had a Thai chicken pizza. When pizza night came around last Friday, I asked my husband to check it out and order and I'd pick up. \nThe Warning Signs: My first issue was not (easily) finding actual order info--a phone number--for Lelulo's, but instead finding the Slice service everywhere as the contact. Against my better judgement, I ordered via this shell website/advertising/delivery engine that is Slice. The app told me the restaurant would send a confirmation via email that the order was received. 15 mins later, I got a call from Slice saying that the restaurant was out of ground beef for the cheeseburger pizza. We switched to the Thai. About a half hour later, I piled the kids in the car and headed over from Murrysville. The place was so full of flour smoke from the ovens, there was genuinely a thick haze in the air, and much like walking into a BINGO hall back in the day, we all immediately smelled of smoke as if we'd been working the ovens for HOURS. Where in the hell is the exhaust in that place? Was it just down for the night? Have they not been cleaning the filters, like, EVER? All I could think about was the poor dudes slinging pies and the Baker's Asthma they were working on. \nThe Reality: I was also disappointed in the look of the place. I mean, I love the Steelers too, but do you have to decorate your restaurant like my Uncle's sad man-cave? Complete with matte black paint and the terrible florescent garage lighting? Unsurprisingly, they told me the order wasn't ready and would need a few minutes, which translated into \"had not yet been started in any way.\" So we sat down at the counter to wait. The woman at the register (possibly Lelulo? Dunno.) cautioned me against using Slice and blamed them for \"never putting the orders in.\" I believe that, because adding a third party can only cause problems, but in a somewhat timely fashion they told us that the place was out of cheeseburger stuff, so....? The kids were hungry and getting cranky, so I bought them each a bag of chips and then spent the next 40 minutes trying to convince my 5 and 7-year-old that just because it LOOKS like a fun video game, Cherry machines are actually for grownups only and regularly texting my husband to confirm that no, we weren't dead in a ditch, we were STILL just waiting for pizza.\nThe Food. Now, I was still pretty excited being that the pizza ovens were real deck ovens, in which real character-laden pizza is made, vs the conveyors that churn out identical picture-perfect but uneventful pizza every 6 1/2 minutes. And, we'd intentionally placed a pretty big order so we could try a range of stuff. Each kid had a small pizza, the girl with a plain white and the boy with a sweet-sauce red pizza with sausage. As mentioned, we ordered the Thai Chicken and we had also opted for something we were SO excited for--the Mustang Muffaletta Flatbread. The Muffaletta:  As you might have guessed, this was by far the most disappointing part of the order. Had these people never had a Muffaletta? Or a flatbread? Couldn't they have at least Googled it first? We expected an open-faced cracker-y pizza dough flatbread with Italian meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and classic Muffaletta pickled giardiniera-type olive salad. We got a sad, folded-over, \"wedgie\" with meats, cheese, and SLICED BLACK OLIVES. Black olives do not a Muffaletta make. \nThe Thai Chicken Pizza: The sauce on this was so confusing, we actually called the place certain we'd received the \"Honey Garlic Sriracha Chicken Pizza\" instead, and I'm still not convinced we didn't. In retrospect, I'm convinced the sauce was just Sweet Thai Chili Sauce, undoctored, unchanged from the bottle it comes in. Cheddar cheese and thai chili sauce--NOT a good combo.\nThe Pizza: Lots of people raved about the dough, and the family recipe \"sweet sauce\". The sauce was fine; just your typical un-cooked canned crushed tomato sauce with some sugar and stuff added. Not terrible, but certainly nothing special. The dough was really disappointing. By the reviews, I expected a dense, chewy crust. We got dense in the form of thick but not at all airy \"bones\" and a thin, crackery bottom. My husband pointed out immediately what the issue was--the dough was Old. It had risen, but it had also fallen, over the course of the day. You can't use 11AM dough at 7PM people unless you've arrested that rising by keeping the dough COLD until you're ready to use it. \nUnbidden Advice:\n1. Lose \"Slice\". Get a kid to make you a $100 website.\n2. Fix Your Exhaust\n3. Make your own damn sauce. Show a little pride and effort.\n4. Paint the place. \n5. Fry up the old dough and sell it as doughnuts\n6. Good luck.","useful":0,"user_id":"dGfWMAns9TKYuSmwrbYNbA"}

The dealership was sold in early 2009 to Hendrick Motors. Our ML320 had serious electrical problems from the beginning, and the dealership (when it was still Beck Imports) tried unsuccessfully for years to remedy the main problem which was unexplained battery drainage. If the vehicle is left parked in our garage for more than 7- 10 days or so the battery completely dies. After years of dealing with this problem, Skipper Beck (the previous owner) and his General Manager gave us a lifetime service warranty on all of the electrical systems of the vehicle for as long as we own the vehicle. They provided this warranty in writing on the Beck Imports company letterhead. The battery on this vehicle died (again) after leaving it in our garage for about 1 week and we called Mercedes Roadside Assistance to get a new battery. To make a very long story short, we were informed by Mark Owen (the Service Manager) that Hendrick Motors of Charlotte would not honor or support the written warranty we had received from Beck Imports. Apparently they have decided (arbitrarily) that they (Hendrick Motors) would refuse to provide the warranty service that we were promised (in writing) by Beck Imports and they claim that they are not obligated to do so since they purchased the dealership in 2009. Needless to say, we do not agree that they are not obligated to honor this written agreement and we will probably end up having to pursue this matter in court if they continue to claim no responsibility. Please see the following quote taken directly from the Hendrick Motors of Charlotte's corporate web site on May 26, 2011: \"Beck Imports has been acquired by the Hendrick Automotive Group of Charlotte, NC. Beck Imports has been renamed: Hendrick Motors of Charlotte. The Beck tradition of excellent customer care in both sales and service is being built upon with the great Hendrick tradition. The Mercedes-Benz heritage of excellence in automotive engineering and performance is enhanced by the Hendrick tradition of providing the ultimate ownership experience.\" In this posting on their own corporate web site, the company (HMOC) itself states that it acquired Beck Imports. It seems that Hendrick Motors of Charlotte is ready and willing to state that they acquired Beck Imports and that \"The Beck tradition of excellent customer care in both sales and service is being built upon with the great Hendrick tradition\" (again from their web site) when it suits them and to disclaim this fact when it does not suit them. I have a written commitment from Beck Imports, on Beck Imports letterhead and signed by their then General Manager, not a \"handshake\" or \"verbal agreement\". Also, it would seem that HMOC, would by their own logic and description, not honor any warranty or service work that was provided by Beck Imports or MB USA on new MB vehicles that were purchased from Beck Imports the month before they acquired Beck Imports. I doubt that this is in fact a business practice HMOC pursued following their purchase of Beck Imports. This appears to be a very clear case of HMOC speaking out of both sides of their mouths at the same time, and publicly stating one thing only to deny it privately when it requires them to do the right thing. Rather than rely on contorted, legalistic and misleading statements to back out of a written commitment they should not hesitate to honor, they should \"conduct their business through core values of respect and dignity\", as they claim. The \"simple legal business aspects\" of their position regarding our situation appear to be anything but simple or straight-forward.","useful":8,"user_id":"oCuDK8x0sf5qNZJW7XZ-Bw"}

We are selling our home and had an inspection that required a leaking pipe be repaired. I called to see if that's something they could do and get an estimate for the work. I was told that the person she was sending out to our house would give us an estimate and could do the work the same day if we wanted to move forward with them. I confirmed with her before hanging up that the work could be done the same day, she stated that the person coming was the owner and he would be the one doing the work. Well the appointment day comes and they sent someone out that only gives estimates, not someone who can do the work. We now live 30-35 minutes away from this home so I wasn't thrilled that they didn't send the original person that could do the work the same day. But I was told I didn't need to be there when he did come do the work since everything was accessible from outside. The estimate was emailed to us later that morning, we accepted it and scheduled them to come out first thing Monday morning. I received a call asking if the appointment could be moved to the following day at the same time, 8am-10am. That was fine with us. Then we get a call again later that day asking if we can switch the appointment to 10:30am-12:30pm, fine again since we didn't have to be there. The next day we get another call asking to move the appointment to Thursday, this time I let her know this is the 4th time we will have this work rescheduled and that we can not move the appointment again. This is for a BINSR and the work has to be done 3 days prior to the buyers taking possession of the house. I wasn't feeling good about the call so I called back to speak to the owner who I was told wasn't available. I spoke with Benjamin and expressed my concerns that we should have had this work done last week had the original appointment been scheduled correctly. We've been asked several times to move our appointment and we're getting down to the deadline to get the work done. I needed a guarantee that they would be there on Tuesday to do the work. Benjamin told me John would for sure be there and get the work done. Today is Tuesday, the day the work is to be done and my husband gets a call from Benjamin that John came out to the house early in the morning to look at the pipe. It's more work than they originally quoted and would be more than double the price. My husband told him to go ahead and do it because we have to get it done today. Benjamin tells my husband that John will have to go get parts and tools to do the work so he didn't know what time he'd be back. Next thing we know their office is calling to tell us they can't do the work and they're referring us to another company. That company would have to come out to see if they could do the work and give us an estimate. They left us scrabbling last minute to get another quote and get the work completed before the deadline. They really need to get their scheduling figured out and not have someone come out to give an estimate for work they can't do themselves, it's obviously not an accurate estimate!","useful":4,"user_id":"PzomDbwG93yETfU4AGLNmw"}

Chris was patient with me and never made me feel rushed as I debated between a few different vehicles (I ended up going with the one I saw online, but ended up wanting to see a few other cars I saw in the parking lot). After making my decision to buy a used car, no manager came out of a mysterious office to try to pressure me into something new or out of my price range, which was nice (I've had this happen at other dealerships before). I was there for a few hours, which is pretty standard, but didn't feel like the paperwork took particularly long. I really liked that all of the paperwork was digital as being eco-friendly when possible is important to me.

It takes a village friends...great docs/office staff, but be mindful of their billing department. I have upgraded their review to three stars since I'm going to be a little nervous of their billing department.\n\nBelow is a copy of the complaint I filed with the BBB after not being able to get Ocotillo Internal Medicine - Gilbert, Billing Manager, Judy, or their Practice Manager, Jimi, to call me back after leaving several messages since Monday, May 13. Ironically, when I went on the BBB site to file my complaint and to for check other complaints, I found that Ocotillo Internal Medicine has a C+ rating for lack of response to complaints, and they're not a member of the BBB...now I know why! I'll wait to see how they respond to this complaint before taking the matter further. According to the BBB, they have 30 days to respond.\n\nThis review is for their billing and practice management only, as I really liked Dr. De Latte, as well as Amanda who answers the phone. \nWhen I posted an inquiry on several local social media pages last night asking if any other patients seem to have had this problem with OIM-Gilbert, it appears to be an all too common complaint regarding this location. Majority of responses were good docs, but a horribly managed location, no return calls, and several of the same billing issues that I had.\n\nCOPY OF BBB COMPLAINT FILED 5/17/19:\nWent to Ocotillo Internal Medicine for a well woman exam, as a first time, new patient on 11/27/18 and apparently was not charged a co-pay. Was told I would need to schedule another appointment for the actual exam as the first time visit is more of a meet-n-greet. Scheduled next appointment for 12/7/18, arrived, checked in, paid co-pay. Nothing mentioned at time of check-in & payment that I owed $30 co-pay from previous visit. On 3/29/19 called OIM Gilbert office, spoke to Amanda to get referral from doc for weight loss clinic. Referral sent on 4/1/19 according to my patient portal. No mention of outstanding $30 copay during the call or on my patient portal. Called OIM Gilbert, 4/22/19 to ask for referral for Cardiologist, no mention of outstanding $30 copay, no return phone call for referral either. Called OIM Gilbert 5/10/19, spoke to Amanda to get letter from doc for weight loss clinic, but told I would need an appointment, but my account had gone in to collections, just that day, for non-payment of $30 copy, + 20 late fee. I let Amanda know I've never received notification of any late charges, or had never been notified during my visit on 12/7/18, or during any of my subsequent phone calls to the office since 12/18. I let Amanda know I would have my husband research our records and get back to them on Monday. Called Monday 5/12/19, spoke to Judy, Billing Manager, and told her I was prepared to pay the $30, but not the late fee since I was unaware. Judy said they sent several letters, and I told Judy they were never received on my end. I asked why they don't call people, and Judy said they called me several times. I asked for dates; Just gave me 1/12/19, 2/8/19 or 2/18/19, 4/18/19 & 5/9/19. I let Judy know I never received those calls either, but she said she had them all in her record and there was nothing she could do. I have pulled my phone records and can prove no calls were made to me by OIM on those dates. I asked for the practice manager, Jimi, to call me back. It is now Friday, 5/17/19, and still no return calls.","useful":0,"user_id":"s52OISBaKgLtFSZRzjhJLw"}

So there's a gym/b-ball court in store? I'd rather go to my local YMCA. The customer service is similar to StarBucks, overbearing. If you want to just browse you can't have headphones in your ear without being harassed. The fact that their display of the Air Jordan lineage does not include Nike Air on the 3-6 models goes to show where the integrity lies. Use the SNKRS app or go to a Nike Outlet. I don't support this overpriced retail junk anymore. On a positive note, there is sometimes displays with insight to the latest releases and cool displays/details. Also they restock popular retro.

I hope this place rises quick before it gets shut down. Step it up people. People want the best service and want to get what they pay for. Definitely think about before ordering here.","useful":1,"user_id":"y4b8y8ruXF9bHtjloXgY5Q"}

That service is nothing more than a bin that UPS infrequently collects from and then hands off to the USPS for delivery. It adds up to THREE WEEKS to your delivery time. This trade off isn't explained on the website. Customer Service will matter-of-factly tell you that after you've been expecting it for two weeks. If you want the part faster, don't bother ordering it again from them. They'll process the order on the following week, when they get around to it. And if you want the part, don't criticize their laziness. They've got enough business that they'll just cancel your order. Oh, and if you ever actually receive the first order that gets to you slower than the proverbial slow boat from China, think twice about returning it.

I've lived here for nearly a year, and after about six months the place has taken a sharp decline. \n\nThe pets here are extremely unregulated. I've had my dog attacked twice by dogs who were unleashed (against the rules) and also of banned breeds (first one was a pit bull, second time was a German Shepherd & some husky mix). \n\nThere is one dog currently here that has shown signs of aggression towards other animals. It's nearly attacked my own dog twice now, with the last time being just a few days ago. The owner walking the dog can't handle it and it broke free from her grip and charged me and my dog. I called the police and send the report to management but they still for some reason don't think the dog is dangerous.\n\nThe police are a constant presence responding to calls around the complex. The forensic team has even paid a visit here, which I happened to spot a while back: (https://imgur.com/a/eXfgq7k)\n\nOn September 12 around midnight, the Chandler PD SWAT team paid a visit to the center of the complex and conducted a full raid on a ground floor unit. (Video link: https://streamable.com/h2jo1). \n\nJefferson Chandler has 31 entries on the Maricopa County Justice Courts website from 2018, involving legal matters with tenants such as eviction:\n\n(http://justicecourts.maricopa.gov/FindACase/caseSearchResults.asp?bName=Jefferson%20Chandler&year=) \n\nThe Met at Fashion Center, just around the corner, has had 8 cases with the most recent one occurring January 25, 2017: \n\n(http://justicecourts.maricopa.gov/FindACase/caseSearchResults.asp?bName=THE%20MET%20AT%20FASHION%20CENTER&year=)  \n\nThe gate to the dog park is notoriously loose and in need of regular repair. On one occasion, a resident told me that a German Shepherd broke through the loose gate and attacked her small dog, severely injuring one of its vertebrae which needed an immediate vet visit. \n\nThe dog park itself is also hazardous in one location where there is a hard to notice and uneven divot in the ground. Someone or their pet is bound to twist an ankle while running around, it's only a matter of time at this point. The dog park is also pitch black at night because during construction they decided that lights weren't necessary for whatever reason.\n\nThis complex also advertises a \"\"\"\"smoke-free\"\"\"\" community which is demonstrably false. There is a constant odor of cigarette smoke and sometimes marijuana as well. People here smoke quite freely since they know nothing is going to happen to them. At one point, the odor of marijuana was so strong from my neighbor's unit that it was stinking up my own apartment.   \n\nThe location is awesome, but there are plenty of other communities around here that would be a much better living situation than this overpriced and dangerous complex.","useful":2,"user_id":"srwBMvKnNy-tow3_LMaTog"}

I made an appointment in advance, to ensure I would get full service since I'm taking off time to be there. I'm glad I did, because it was super busy (weekend).\n\nI am taking off one star because it was a bit of a mess getting served, even though I had an appointment. We weren't greeted when we first walked in, no big deal. Eventually, we found someone and told them we had an appointment. They asked us to sign in, and told us someone would come get us. I think we waited for about 5-10 mins until someone got us. Not a big deal, but the process was a bit all over the place. \n\nTHE SELECTION\nThe selection was quite good. They had a variety of bridal (as well as other bridesmaids' and other) dresses throughout the store. I am a very picky person and I didn't find myself at a loss for selection. \n\nTHE SERVICE\nOur consultant was Phoebe, who seemed very knowledgeable. She asked to see pictures of what I wanted so she could get a sense of what to show me. She was pretty spot on. She immediately understood that I did not want a flashy or poofy dress, and that I was going for something refined and elegant. She helped clip the dress back, and gave me some advice on how I could alter it. She added lace to my sleeves to show me how nice longer sleeves would look, and she brought over a couple of belts to show me how that would add a nice touch to the dress. She was right, and her suggestions added a lot to the dress. I didn't know that people altered dresses significantly, and her advice helped me explore the possibilities.\n\nOn a personal level, she was quite funny. She was constantly making jokes, and made the experience fun. We really liked working with her. \n\nTHE PRICE\nI told my consultant my budget, and asked her not to show me anything that would put me above the budget. I explained that that was my budget all-in (including alterations). I got a great price on the dress I really liked. YMMV because I was buying a sale dress in a somewhat smaller size. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: Make an appointment (not on a weekend if you can help it) and go see Phoebe.","useful":1,"user_id":"p7KpwlPgfpUPQGeD-8bCvw"}

We went with them because they had guaranteed service, and a one day move.  We have previously used two men and a truck and had no issues with them, they moved us without a problem, how ever for this move they said it would take 2 days and Movers 4 less said they would have it done in one day so we went with them.  I scheduled the move over a month in advance I had someone come to the house and gave me a quote.  A week before my move I heard from them, confirmed that they were coming, they had a couple questions which I answered.  The day before my move which was scheduled for a Saturday, they called at about 6pm they confirmed my move information and schedule for 9 am.  The next day at 8 am I received a phone call telling me that they did not have a truck available for my move.  I did not understand because they had told me that they had there own trucks, however come to find out they rent other trucks from other companies like u-hal, Ryder, and other moving vehicles. \n\nThe person I spoke to on the phone said that she had tried to get a u-haul truck and had also called other companies to try and get a truck but was not successful.  At this point all I could do was try to find a truck myself.  I did find a u-haul truck,  but I still needed the movers, I called the company back to let them know and I was told that getting movers would be an issue because some of there people don't have drivers license so they are not sure how they would get to my new location.  I was finally called back an hour later and told that the movers would be at my house in 30 minutes. I was told movers would still be bringing straps, furniture protectors, and mattress covers. I advised that I was not willing to pay there normal rate because I had to pay for my own truck and all the other issues I have had with there company.  The person on the phone said she was going to send 3 guys and reduced the hourly rate of there fee.  By this time it was already 11am, so I had expected movers to be there.  At noon movers were still not there, I called at 12, and at 12:30 and at 1pm still no movers. Finally about 1:45 movers showed up.  When I called the woman on the phone was so incredibly rude to me and actually blamed me for taking the truck that they would have gotten and then the movers would have been on time.  I explained that I only secured the truck after I was called and informed that the moving company I had hired to move me was apparently a fraud because they don't have there own trucks and then I was told they couldn't get a truck at all. \n\nAt this point I am extremely upset with this company, when the movers get there at 1:45 and they have none of the items they were supposed to have. No moving pads, no straps, no mattress covers.  They start moving items and they are working incredibly slow, they had no idea how to load a truck, and one of the guys just stood around looking confused the whole time.  \n\nWe finished loading the truck and went to our new location, when we get there they slowly unloaded the truck while the 3rd guy sat in his vehicle for over an hour not doing anything.  We have a bed frame that moves and is very heavy, the movers refused to take it up the stairs, they said there was no way they could get it up there and left it in the hall way.  However after they left we were able to take the frame apart and get it up the stairs.  The fact that the movers were not able to figure this out and refused to do so was unacceptable.  They finished unloading the truck and I needed to pay them I added up the few hours that they were actually there and told the head mover that I as writing the check for that amount.  He then told me, that was not correct and I was supposed to be paying for his mileage for him driving his own vehicle to move the items.  I explained however that this was not a  part of the agreement and I as not paying that.  \n\nAll in all this was the worst company to deal with rude customer service, slow workers, not reliable, and they do not have there own trucks.  I would definitely go with  two men and a truck next time.","useful":0,"user_id":"RkQuVFGu2JouAMKHzDh6aw"}

But each time I would muster up the courage to write something I would avoid doing so for fear it'll reflect poorly on my experience moving forward. However, at this point, there have just been too many negatives for me to hold back any longer, and hopefully if someone reads this they'll address some of my concerns so I can update this review to a higher level.\n\nStaff\nFor the most part I would say the reception staff and some of the sales people are friendly, but there have been more than enough times when I've asked questions about classes and no one seems to have a clue what's going on. My main issue is with the guy they send you to for your MMA assessment when you first join. They call him MMA Jay. Jay is responsible for doing a fitness assessment, measurements (setting your bench marks), and assessing your skill set/experience in Mixed Martial Arts. Having no experience I expected they would tell me as much and then suggest personal training, which Jay did point for point. My issue was, this was all he focused on, I was never given a fitness assessment, never given my benchmark, just basically told I didn't know what I was doing and that I needed to take personal training. I would have bought sessions anyway but the blatant sales routine was what irked me.\n\nThe MMA trainers have some bright spots, the ladies boxing coach seems to be an incredible teacher, as is the beginning Muay Thai teacher and one of the other Muay Thai instructors. Past that I've found that the other classes have a certain level to them and the instructors don't do very much to show you the ropes, it's basically sink or swim. I had wanted to do the 2 hour Muay Thai Class but after one class with the instructor catering to his advanced fighters and leaving the rest of us to our own devices I was done with him (so that limits 2-3 class options a week). Similarly, I went to try BJJ during the day and the same thing happened. An advanced class with very little instruction, mostly student to student lead. I've yet to take another BJJ class. And then we come to boxing... something I would have loved to have tried but after two failed attempts I'm pretty turned off. On my first attempt the teacher didn't show up and a sub showed up 30 minutes into class who was also an Muay Thai coach, the same one who I mentioned earlier who catered to the more experience fighters and left the rest of us alone. The regular boxing teacher came up to me another time while I was putting my wraps on before class and because he had never seen me before in his class, told me if I wasn't hear for boxing class I had to leave the area because they had the area booked off, and then walked away before I could explain that was precisely what I was here for; so now I can scratch Boxing and BJJ off my list along with 1/4 Muay Thai teachers. I will say that the beginner MT instructor as well as the new Tuesday night instructor and 90 minute Monday class instructor are all very good and have been the saving grace for this gym (they earn the gym it's full two stars on their own, so kudos to them)\n\nClasses (MMA)\nAs I mentioned above, many of the classes offer little basic explanations and your must either sink or swim. If you're going to run a gym like this, you need to offer levels so that it doesn't just cater to regulars but welcomes new comers as well. My biggest gripe with this gym is that all the MMA classes are on weekday evenings. The only early options are the mid day BJJ classes which I can't go to anymore. I'd really like to see some morning classes as that's the time I work out usually so it doesn't interfere with work.\n\nFitness Equipment\nI've only used the exercise equipment a few times, and that's mostly because anytime I've attempted the gym has been packed and you cannot get a rack or weight to save yourself. The weights are in such a state of disorder I you'll spend half of your workout looking for the match to the weight you've got in your hand. There are many machines out of order and a fair number of gym rat douchers sit around \"reserving\" machines and weights in between sets. Xtreme Coutours staff... I don't know what they do here, most of the treadmills and everything is a mess\n\nFacilities (bathroom/change room)\nBare bare bones. Concrete floors, busted up/rusted lockers, many of which are reserved and/or covered in stickers. The showers are the scariest thing in my opinion, as I know they are cleaned but they certainly don't look the part. \n\nThe Farce:\nSomeone else mentioned this, but aside from maybe when the gym opened neither Randy Coutour, nor any other professional fighter has ever come and done a class here, however looking at their website would have you believe that their presence is a regular occurrence... nope.\n\nMaybe they'll make some changes, maybe not, but I think when my year is up, I'll be done... that remains to be seen.","useful":24,"user_id":"WeVkkF5L39888IPPlRhNpg"}

I would go out of my way to tell friends and family how great this place was.  Then I had this issue:\n\nI'd like to start with saying that I have been an autohausaz customer for 3 1/2 years and have been so impressed with your company that I have sung your praises to all my friends and family.  That being said I am extremely disappointed in my last order. \n\nI placed the order on 8/28 and was hoping to receive it by 9/2.  Your shipping has always been very quick.  I received an email stating that the motorcraft air filters I ordered were on backorder with no eta. I didn't want to sub another brand because I try to use OEM whenever possible.  I was told the filters would be refunded and everything else would still ship Friday.  Then I get another email stating that my order was delayed because of a warehouse issue and would not ship until Tuesday, 9/2.  I asked if it was a separate delay from the motorcraft air filters and was told it was not.  Hmm....  I did receive my shipment today and noticed that the Mann MA1198 air filter had been swapped with Purolator A35592.  According to your website this filter is $7 and change but I was still charged the $8.69 for the Mann filter.  I'm not really concerned about the $1 difference, but more the disappointing out-of-stock issue and then the switcharoo on the Mann filter.  I have always used the Mann air filter for my wife's Subaru.  I must say that where autohausaz has been my \"go to\" place for all maintenance parts in the past, in the future, I'll be compelled to shop around. \n\nThat was an email I sent to them 09/15/04.  No response....After 2 years, I was having trouble finding front wiper blades for my wife's 2006 Subaru Tribeca.  The design was changed on newer Tribecas to a more universal one.  It's almost impossible to find wipers outside of going to the dealership for the 2006 model.  Searched autohausaz and found them!!  Received Friday and attempted to install Saturday.  Nope....Called the 1800 number, it's not working (can't be completed as dialed).  Called the local number and after holding for more than 10 minutes (phones keep track), I told that I will receive an email with the return postage and my money will be refunded once they receive the wipers.  While I understand they want their parts back, I want my wasted time back from dealing with their inadequacies [Inaccurate info under parts for 2006 Subaru Tribeca, don't bother to respond to customers' emails (look at all the others reviews), poor customer service, etc.]  Too many other competitors to waste more time with this rapidly declining business.  Pay close attention to the accolades on their website.  All are, at least, 5 years old.

Looking online the stocked a wide range of designers so I thought it was a good place to visit. I called to make an appointment, the women who took my details was slightly abrupt and didn't send an email confirmation - but hey, I just assumed they were slightly old school. My mam and sister (visiting from Ireland) came to my appointment with me. When we arrived the whole place seemed a tad chaotic, we were eventually greeted and told someone would be with us shortly but there was nowhere to sit or wait. There were loads of people moving around. The shop is very dated looking. Eventually our consultant came (Eastern European accent, red highlighted hair) and brought us upstairs and barked at my mam when she didn't remove her shoes before stepping onto the carpeted stairs. Upstairs she asked what kind of dress I wanted and I explained. She started pulling dresses out and saying 'this one?', when I said no I felt like I was nearly putting the consultant out by saying no. The dresses didn't seem to be in much order and all the price points were mixed together, many of the dresses were very old fashioned. Eventually I picked some and we placed them in the changing room. The consultant did not help me in or out of any of the dresses. My Mam and sister ended up doing the zipper up on most of them. The clips they had to pins the dresses were old and broken and popped off when I moved. When I came out in the first dress my Mam took out her phone to take a picture, the consultant very abruptly pointed at the small sign on the mirror that said no photos. My Mam explained that two of my sisters were back in Ireland (as they couldn't afford to fly over) and that I wouldn't be purchasing a dress without them seeing it. We were told that once we put the deposit down we could take photos?! The consultant told us it wasn't her choice but the owners choice. The other 3 salons we had been to before this (much fancier ones) allowed us to take as many photos as we wanted. We found this very strange and unfair, especially given how my sisters were not in the country. One dress I tried on everyone loved it, it was perfect. My mam took some photos inconspicuously and the consultant very loudly scolded her and asked did we think she was stupid that she had said no photos - I understand her point but she could have turned a blind eye given the situation. In the end we felt pressured to buy the dress, I explained that as my sisters had not seen it I could not purchase it and would have to have a think about it. We had driven 45 minutes to attend this appointment and even though I loved the dress I would not purchase it there as the service was so awful. They have a large notice up saying no dress fittings on the weekends too! I left with such a sour taste in my mouth.

Called customer service and had no issues with placing another order ASAP and sending me a return label. A week later on Thursday (today), received the part. Still the wrong part. Called customer service and told them the situation that it was the second time and about two weeks after my initial order. \n\nHe mentioned that they don't know what the problem is whether it is a packaging issue from BMW or a warehouse issue (most likely that) as the part number on the part was exactly what showed on the packaging slip (which was also wrong). They were going to escalate the issue to see what the issue was and whether I still wanted the part. \n\nOf course I need it, but not willing to wait another week or two to get it. I said I would wait if they would give me some kind of discount or something to help compensate for all this trouble and time wasted. They told me that they would not be able to do that since it's a genuine BMW part and they already have little margins on it, so I told them to send me a return label and that I was done ordering parts from them.\n\nI understand that occasionally there are warehouse issues but at least some compensation for the customer in this situation would have been nice. I'm 10 dollars less (for the original shipping), two weeks behind (more actually), and still waiting for the correct part to finally start the engine.\n\nUnfortunately they missed out because there are plenty of parts that I need to order for a project car and I will be taking my business else where.

Like they (LA Fitness) are totally fine in some aspects- they have a decent array of equipment and yeah the machines get full at peak hours but that's pretty normal in gyms, get over it winney babies. BUT they (you know LA Fitness) suck so bad at customer service! so bad. \n\nalright, so I sign up and I was able to talk the \"show you the gym and get you to sign up\" guy to give me a decent deal, I thought? Plus at signing up I found out I get a free personal training sesh, yay! I like it! I'm no stranger to the gym but I can always learn more right? So this is where the fun starts. \n\nOK so, I make an appt for my free sesh for the next Tuesday evening. You know because I have a JOB and I can't come in during the day. So I show up at my free sesh the next Tuesday 5 minutes late, my bad I didnt plan well. Front desk girl, who is obviously stupid-- by the way, says to go sit on the couches because my trainer isn't ready for me yet. So I'm like, \"ah, I get it. You're punishing me for being late. I understand I was really naughty in being late, I'll wait for 5 minutes or so to make it up to you.\" K SO where I'm sitting I can plainly see my trainer in the window's reflection. Home girl is like gabbing away with one of her friends or clients or whatever at her desk. I CAN SEE THAT IS WHATS HAPPENING. I'm not that naive. Anyways I wait for like 20 minutes, watching the gab fest go down. SO then the trainers girlfriend, client, whatever leaves, (I can see this all happening because of the reflection in the window) and THEN homegirl picks up the phone and does something. Like 2 seconds later stupid front desk girl comes up to me and goes: \"Um, so you're trainer is double booked (Mind you it is now 7:45 pm on a tuesday night) and she can't see you.\" \n\nI KNOW i'm being lied to but I have no way to prove I'm being lied to. Anyways I figure I'lll play the docile customer role and just reschedule. So I tell Stupid Front Desk Girl I want to make a new appointment. Well at that moment Stupid Front Desk Girl is SO overwhelmed with like 4 people checking in at once she can't put my new appointment in the system so she writes it down on a little piece of paper and assures me that I will have a new appointment next week. I smelled trouble then. \n\nSoooooo on the day of my next appointment, feeling some doubts in my heart, I call ol' LA fitness to confirm my appointment. AAaaaaand they don't have it in the system. Shocking. It was then and there I came up with my new game I play with the LA Fitness people. I tell the person at the front desk \"You know, this isn't your problem, but your boss or whatever, corporate culture? HAS LIKE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE WORLD.\" she kinda like mumbled a few things and didn't even offer to reschedule a new personal training sesh. I kinda figured- eh I give up on the free training session. \n\nOk so then some time passes and during that time I lose the credit card I put my gym membership on. I cancel the card, like a responsible human being, and then carry on with my life. So come the first of the month I get a call from LA Fitness at 8am about my card being rejected. Well that day I was flying, like across the country, so I didn't have time to deal with the whole card snaffu. I figure I'll fix the matter next week, pay the people, and all will be fine... Um apparently thats not how it works at LA Fitness because I got 5, yes 5 more calls that day about my card not working. Finally, on call 4, I cave pick up the phone, and I say \"You know my cards not working, I intend to fix the problem, BUT don't you find it kind of ridiculous you people are hounding me with phone calls? Please leave me alone, I will fix this but I'm traveling today and I really don't have time to deal with this (kind of a lie, but whatevs)\" Anyways the lady on the phone was like \"ok ok ok we won't call and you can get this fixed next week\" and I'm like PERFECT.  ------- then call 5 comes. \n\nso then I play the game again, guy on the phone wants to know about the dead card, and I'm like \"you know, YOU PEOPLE HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PLANET. I know it's not your fault homeboy, but I already said I would fix this problem to SOMEONE ELSE ON THE PHONE SO STOP BOTHERING ME. I'M BUSY WITH LIFE SHIT.\" \n\nahhhh see and then I got my way again. they left me alone. \n\nAnywho, so I like LA Fitness, the facilities are fine, not great, but it works. I like it. and its fairly clean. which is good. plus they seem to have lots of classes, ones i have never done but hey! its still cool.","useful":1,"user_id":"BQZVkPkLYI7csC94iO1CoQ"}

The manager had no issue with honoring the deal in spite of. I'll start by saying that I was NOT looking forward to coming here. AT ALL, because I am no fan of guns, whatsoever. But because my husband owns and gun and would like for me to have one for safety, it's imperative that I learn to use it and become comfortable. Upon entering, I scaled my anxiety at about a 7/10. We were greeted by the staff and asked to sign waivers. We watched a safety video and picked out our guns and target. The staff was super patient with this being my first time and encouraged me to start out with a glock 9mm. Walking into the firing area, my anxiety was at about an 8.5/10 but I tried to  work through it. But bayyyby, when I heard that first gun go off in the lane beside me, I felt my knees go weak and I was about to pass out!! I took a moment to gather myself and make sure i hadn't peed myself (lol!) and became more comfortable by the end of the experience. My husband intended to use his personal gun, but just his luck, the flipping key broke off in the lock of his carrier. Fortunately, a staff member was able to get it out when we finished up and mentioned that it's something that happens to people fairly often. Before leaving, I was able to talk to the gentleman in the next lane over and he was a professional, mentioning that he had been shooting since he was 5yo and it's like a community at that range where they host events frequently and offered tips on how i could feel more comfortable with firing a gun. We also spoke with an employee at the sales counter and he was extremely informative. He encouraged us to come back and mentioned ladies night that is weekly and would be a great fit for me. We will absolutely be returning in the near future and i would recommend this range! I can't compare it to any other ranges in the area, but I know that I felt WAY more comfortable when we were leaving than I did going in, mostly because of the friendly, patient, and well-educated staff!!","useful":0,"user_id":"jaVZ1pbPtg0pjndbKrDggg"}

The ladies looked at my mom, my sister, and I; judged us and pointed to the clearance section: \"The sale section is over there.\" Mind you, this was my second wedding place and after having such a good experience at the first, my expectations were set.\n\nI told the lady, that we have an appointment for trying on wedding dresses but that we were early. She said that was fine and that I should just go over there and look at the clearance section. She did not bother asking me my name or introducing herself. This is when I knew I would not be giving these people my money. I started looking at the clearance dresses, browsing through (while some random customers were taking photos). This is when the lady came over and asked me what I was looking for. She was still not smiling and still did not ask my about my wedding, the date, or even my name. When I told her the type of dress I wanted, she quickly pushed me to a different section, telling me I can't look here. I explained to her that I was browsing all the dresses as I want to see what this store has to offer.\n\nAfter she continued watching us, not much interaction, I asked her if we can go upstairs to take a look at the other dresses. It was at this point that she asked me what my budget was. When I told her, she scowled and said that this section is all I can afford so I cannot go upstairs. I should have walked out at this moment but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said that if I found the perfect dress, that I would obviously be willing to pay more. How can someone treat you like this and judge you before you even try a dress on?\n\nAfter we walked around without picking any dress, she decided to take us upstairs. My mom and my sister were not impressed, but we decided to go up and try. the heat was blasting up there so it was extremely hot and uncomfortable. We tried to get comfortable and begin browsing again and she comes over and says this is expensive, you need to look towards this section. She also told us to make sure we look at size and price. Again, she still did not smile, or ask me my name, or tell me hers.\n\nWhen I finally tried on some dresses, I did find one that was perfect. However, the minute I smiled and said I liked it, she tells me the price, she pushes the sale on me. She tells me I do not have any time to decide because I have to order if I want the dress before the wedding as it takes them 6-8 months. I understand this point, but the fact that she was extremely pushy, knew nothing about my wedding style or what my name was, I already knew I did not want to give her my money. This place does not allow photos for you to look at different angles to think about the dress, so I just did not want to be there anymore.\n\nWhen we finally were ready to leave, she told me I have to buy it soon. It was at the end that we exchanged names. But who would want to buy a dress from a place that treats you like crap. A place that sees you like you are just a number. A place that doesn't even have the courtesy to take the time with you, to get to know you and your style, to get to know the people who are with you.\n\nI just can't. I despised this place and would NEVER recommend it to anyone.","useful":4,"user_id":"SM8v1Dn93u3wcR_wdH6NcA"}

You'll never see them. Only Physician Assistants are available, and there's a long rotation of them, and they're way overbooked.\n\nDon't bother leaving a message, they don't call you back. I had an emergency one day, left a message and waited until the next day with no call back. I again call and tell the front office girls I didn't receive a call back and left another message to get a call back. And guess what? No one ever called me!! \n\nSave yourself the trouble and avoid at all costs! Here's why:\n\n1. Neither office saves appointments for when you're sick or need to be seen. You'll wait a couple days to be seen and sometimes that just isn't an option when there's something really wrong!\n\n2. The office staff is rude, and acts like you're a burden as soon as you walk through the door. Instead of being greeted by a friendly face with customer service skills - you're just asked point blank why your there, with a blank stare, acting like you just interrupted them by simply being there.\n\n3. I was misdiagnosed in a big way. I had to go to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days after seeing a PA at the Chandler office. I could've had a stroke had I not gone with my gut feeling of something bigger being wrong. Listen to your bodies!\n\n4. I was told today there are no appointments for the next 2 days, but there are \"walk in\" appointments at the Chandler appointment. I drive 40 minutes to and from the office, for nothing, as I'm told they stopped accepting walk ins upon arrival. I had to go to the urgent care and spend $100 co-pay when my normal office co-pay is $40. They cost me $60 and 40 minutes of my time for nothing.\n\n5. I'm finally fed up at this point and ask to speak to a manager. She's on maternity leave! Unfortunately it is very apparent no manager is overseeing this disgrace of an operation, because if they were it would and should run like a well oiled machine. I told the assistant manager all the issues I've had and her lack of response made me realize I unfortunately need to find a new doctors office - her response, \"Okay.\" Another blank stare response. \n\nThey simply do not care about their patients or their health and it's sad to see.","useful":5,"user_id":"qmUong6_smgjnwmG5VNStQ"}

How can something so seemingly simple, take so much time?\n- I prepaid for multiple years of service when I purchased my car. On more than 1 occasion, when I've brought my car in for a service they have \"accidentally\" charged me again for a service I already paid for. Getting reimbursed was a complicated nightmare. \n- Routine service appointments often take quite a bit longer than they quote you. For example, I was here for 4 hours recently after they told me on the phone it would be at most a 1.5 hour service.\n- I can't bring my car in for a service without a sales person then calling me and asking if I want to look at a new car while mine is in for a service. I want to opt out of these annoying calls. \n\nOverall, this is a car dealership.

Purchased a ML350 from here and before I had even made my first payment it was in the shop because it had left me stranded by refusing to start. They claimed they had no idea what was wrong.

This time it was a code that needed upgraded and sent back home. This last time was the straw that broke the camel's back. It left me stranded at night. Transmission completely locked up. Took 4 hours to get a tow. So in the dark I wait until 11pm for a tow. Dealership calls the next day. No progress. No idea what is wrong with it. Two more days later they replace a steering column module and hope that's the fix. During this process the service men are telling me that this car is not typical and they would not feel safe putting their wives and girlfriends in this car with all the problems it is having. I go in to speak to the manager expecting with the prestige of the Mercedes name that they will want to stand behind their product and make this right. Instead I am told that my car has depreciated over the last 4 months and 9000 miles I had added to it by right at 10k less than my financed amount. I could only trade it in as if I didn't want it anymore and eat the cost of the difference. Infuriated I argue. My anger turned to tears at how they could be so indifferent to a faulty vehicle that they sold and even though it was still under warranty and getting fixed for free it was leaving me stranded around once a month. I have missed work. I am afraid to drive it period. What happened instead is I went to Mercedes of South Charlotte which is not a Hendricks owned establishment and dealt with people instead of a bottom line and even though they made nothing on the ML350 they put me in the Mercedes name was restored and they have gotten a return customer in me. The service Dept at Hendricks was the only positive thing at that place.
